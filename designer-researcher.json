As a researcher, you’ll design, conduct, analyze, and present qualitative research to product teams. You’ll be a key member of a CDS product team and help the team make design decisions based on the insights you discover. You’ll navigate the policy and regulatory constraints of conducting research inside government. You’ll present to partner departments and teach our partners new research skills. You’ll help your fellow CDS team members become better researchers as well, (We believe every CDS team member is a researcher in some way.)
