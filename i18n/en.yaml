partnerships-intro:

  other: "How it works"
partnerships-how-we-do-it-1st:
  other: "We work with our partners in the open, regularly sharing progress via public platforms. This creates a culture of learning and fosters best practices. And it means non-partner departments can apply our work and use our resources to develop their own services."
partnerships-how-we-do-it-2nd:
  other: "Together, we form a team that follows the ‘Agile software development methodology’. This means we begin with an intensive <span class='discovery'>'Discovery'</span> research phase to explore user needs and possible solutions to meeting those needs. After that, we move into a prototyping <span class='alpha'>'Alpha'</span> phase to find and test ways to meet user needs. Next comes the <span class='beta'>Beta</span> phase, where we release the solution to the public and intensively test it. Lastly, the <span class='live'>Live</span> phase, where the service is fully released and continues to be monitored and improved upon."
partnerships-how-we-do-it-3d:
  other: "Between the <span class='beta'>Beta</span> and <span class='live'>Live</span> phases,  our team members step back from the service, and the partner team in the department continues the maintenance and development. We can help partners recruit their service team from both internal and external sources."
