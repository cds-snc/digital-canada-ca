After that, we move into a prototyping <span class='term'>'Alpha'</span> phase to find and test ways to meet user needs. Next comes the <span class='term'>'Beta'</span> phase, where we release the solution to the public and intensively test it. Lastly, there is a <span class='term'>'Live'</span> phase, where the service is fully released and continues to be monitored and improved upon."
