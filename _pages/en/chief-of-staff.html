			<p>The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) works with federal departments to make the services people depend on simple and easy-to-use. We’re a small but mighty team that is rethinking service design and delivery, engaging users every step of the way. By working in the open, and connecting partners with tools, talent, and training grounded in practice, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.</p>
			<p>We’re looking for someone to support our CEO and senior management team. From streamlining activities in a high-volume office to coordinating the execution of strategic initiatives, you’ll ensure the priorities of the CEO stay on track and get done. You’ll work across the organization to keep lines of communication open and foster the partnerships required for long-term success. You’ll navigate the barriers that keep the team from operating at speed, while simultaneously writing the playbook that reduces organizational friction for everyone. Your efforts will help other members of the leadership team to work together more effectively and get decisions at the top made faster. </p>

			<h3>What we’re looking for:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>You continually create clarity and structure in the world around you. You’re comfortable working with senior leaders, helping them operationalize their strategic priorities, identifying areas in need of focus, and identifying metrics for success. You revisit progress regularly and adjust as needed. Experience in agile environments is a plus, as is experience with OKRs.</li>
				<li>You shepherd cross-functional, organization-wide projects and initiatives, bringing together multiple stakeholders and driving decisions. You liaise effectively with the offices of the Secretary, Minister, and other senior officials at the Treasury Board Secretariat and across the government.</li>
				<li>You understand how government works and the systems used to run it. You manage the bureaucracy with ease, escalating as needed to keep priority initiatives on track. You manage (and sometimes run) executive meetings, ensuring time is well spent and objectives are achieved. </li>
				<li>You give bold, informed, and — when necessary — contrary advice. You have a bias toward action and an appetite for challenging the status quo. You are passionate about making Canada a better place and strive to keep people focused on that outcome.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>An excellent candidate will be able to:</h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Keep the CEO on track to meet commitments and support accountability for results across the team.</li>
				<li>Bring structure and a steady operational cadence to a fast-moving organization,  without becoming a “gatekeeper.”</li>
				<li>Think on their feet, providing interpretation and advice for the CEO as they engage partners and stakeholders inside and outside government.</li>
				<li>Complete priority items for the CEO to an appropriate level of quality.</li>
				<li>Collaborate and co-create with partners and stakeholders, building capacity as you go.</li>
				<li>Understand that time is the most critical asset.</li>
				<li>Learn from failure.</li>
				<li>Model a culture of inclusive delivery and uphold principles of openness, integrity, and fairness.</li>
                <li>Communicate in both official languages.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we can recognise and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.</p>
			
			<p>CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments.</p>
