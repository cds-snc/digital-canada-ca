        <h2 class="section--title"> We need your help</h2>

        <p>We are currently working with the Department of Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) to create an online tool that will make it easier for Canadian Veterans to determine which VAC benefits and services are relevant to them. We are looking for voluntary participants to help us ensure that our tool will work well for the people who will use it.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in participating, or know someone who is, please contact <a href="mailto:daniel.tse@tbs-sct.gc.ca">daniel.tse@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a> for more information on how to be involved.</p>
        
        <h2>What it looks like</h2>

        <p>We show participants an example of the online tool and ask them to describe their thoughts and impressions. Each session takes from 20 minutes to no more than an hour.</p>
        <p>Please note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Participation is <strong>voluntary</strong> and participants may stop at any time for any reason;</li>
            <li>Responses will be <strong>confidential</strong>, which means they will not be linked back to anyone;</li>
            <li>Participation will <strong>not affect access</strong> to Government of Canada services or benefits; and</li>
            <li>CDS handles personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act, participants will be given a copy of our Privacy Statement.</li>
        </ul>
