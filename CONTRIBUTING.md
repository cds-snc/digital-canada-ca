# Contributing

We welcome all contributions both internal and outside of CDS!

## Contributing CMS managed content

The following forms of content are managed by our CMS, Strapi:

- Blog Posts
- Job Posts
- Product cards ( Partnerships, Tools, and Resources ) and associated info:
  - Contacts for the above
  - Product Links
- CDS Team Members

These types of content must be updated through Strapi, otherwise updates will be overwritten by subsequent Strapi builds.

If you are internal to CDS, and would like to update any of the above content, please contact Victoria Chan or the website team to get set up with a Strapi account.
If you are external to CDS, and would like to update any CMS managed content, continue to make a PR as you would normally, and request that your changes be migrated into the CMS.
