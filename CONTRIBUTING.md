## CDS Contributions
To contribute content edits, blog posts, or bugfixes, create a branch from `master` and submit a pull request.  A 
member of the publishing team will review your changes, and once approved, will merge and deploy.

## Branches and Deployment
There are two protected branches: `master` and `production`.  

Circle-ci will automatically build, test, and deploy anything that is pushed to the `production` branch.  

## Pull Requests
To make a change, first create a branch from `master` and create a Pull Request on Github.  In the Pull Request, please
cite any issues your change addresses, or provide a brief description of the change.

When complete, tag a member of the web team who should review and merge your PR.

Once a PR has been reviewed and approved, publishers should merge changes into `master`, and then when ready to deploy, 
merge `master` into `production` and push.
