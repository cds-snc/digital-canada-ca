The services our government provides play an important role in the lives of millions of people. 

That is why we’ve launched the Canadian Digital Service, a team focused on redesigning services from the user’s perspective. We are [recruiting an experienced and inspiring Chief Executive](/talent/ceo/) to lead the team in executing a bold agenda with a lasting impact.

The CEO of CDS will have a broad mandate to fundamentally improve federal service delivery across the enterprise, with partner departments. This person will have the strongest support from the top to put users back at the center of everything we do.

In the past few months, I’ve spoken with digital service leaders around the world about what works and what they’ve learned. I’ve come away with a strong belief that the right leader for this role has a track record of shipping digital products and services that make a difference in people’s lives. They are an exceptional team-builder and creative partner, with a laser-like focus on implementation – and the ability to execute on their vision. 

The right candidate is also inclusive, committed to the principles of openness, integrity, and fairness, and understands the connection between service delivery and public trust in government. 

The CEO of CDS will have a seat at the senior management table of the Treasury Board Secretariat, the central agency which houses CDS and sets policies for all departments and agencies. As a peer and partner to the Government of Canada CIO, the CEO will be able to scale service innovation through standards that raise the bar for the entire government.

If you’re excited by the opportunity we have before us as a government, as I am, I hope you will apply. As an immigrant to Canada, I learned the importance of service experience first-hand a long time ago. Whether we’re serving our nation’s immigrants, veterans, seniors, or the many other people and communities that depend on us government, we have an obligation to provide services that are easy to access and simple to use.

This is a unique opportunity to lead change for our country. You will make a difference.
