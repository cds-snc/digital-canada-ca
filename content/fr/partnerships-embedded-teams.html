  <p>
    Embedded Teams change how your organization designs and delivers services through hands-on, co-creation with your teams. We coach by delivering with you, not for you. In other words, we're full-time coaches and consultants, not staff augmentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our teams are staffed with experienced people holding practical knowledge in UX design, user research, software development, product management, operations (i.e. devops, change management, gov ops, etc.). Prior to and during their CDS tenure, they've shipped digital services at scale in the private sector and within government.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our services are free to other Government of Canada departments (i.e. we are <em>not</em> cost recoverable), but we <em>will</em> need access to your time, people, data, and service users AND an open mind to try new things.
  </p>

  <h2>What might we do with you?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Map out your service to understand user touchpoints, challenges, bottlenecks, etc.</li>
    <li>Redesign your web application, website, or interactions with users based on those users needs</li>
    <li>Introduce modern product and project management tactics</li>
    <li>Migrate to the cloud and adopt DevOps culture</li>
    <li>Revise your security processes to decrease risk and be helpful rather than just blindly blocking everything</li>
    <li>Hire or train your upcoming digital service team</li>
    <li>Examine how your org structure is impacting delivery</li>
    <li>Meet and get to know the users of your service</li>
    <li>Rescue a distressed service</li>
    <li>Make your services more accessible and inclusive</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What will we not do?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Code an app <em>for</em>, not with you</li>
    <li>(OTHER THINGS?)</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Example Engagement</h2>
    <p>
      The Department of Widgets Canada (or, Widgets Canada) wants to encourage gizmo buying for the betterment of society. They are launching a grant program that gives money to families to purchase their first gizmo. They want people to register for the Gizmo Grant online, but last time they did something like this for the Contraption Grant, it went very poorly. The site went down often, users had trouble using it, and they wound up with an unmanagable backlog of grant applications and emails to process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Widgets Canada's Gizmo Program Office reaches out to CDS to get expert help. Together, CDS and Widgets Canada have a one hour <strong>Intake Meeting</strong> to better understand the request, define desired outcomes, and what Widget Canada's current capacity and capabilities are. Later that week, CDS decides to help out with an Embedded Team.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Embedded Team begins by doing a two week <strong>Discovery Sprint</strong> (note: calling this by a common term rather than the branded Exploration). This allows the team to understand where the service is today, what challenges exist, and form an informed hypothesis on how to improve the service and ways of working.
    </p>

    <p>
      The discovery report finds that the proposed website isn't accessible, may not be able to handle the traffic to it, and that the program and IT offices are having trouble working together. This is communicated back to Widgets Canada leadership and CDS asks if help is desired working on one or more of these challenges. Widgets Canada does want help, and agrees to CDS's conditions to provide program and IT individual contributors to work side-by-side with CDS and to clear blockers that may arise while trying new approaches. This arrangement is outlined in a short <strong>Partnerships Agreement</strong> document, which creates a unified Widget Canada and CDS team to work the defined scope. This joint team is able to make decisions and implement new processes and code for the Gizmo Grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this next phase, Widgets Canada and CDS <strong>Co-create New Processes and Software</strong>. By working together hands-on, Gizmo Grant program officers learn how to design a web page better from a CDS designer and members from the IT group learn how to deploy the grant application software to the cloud from a CDS software developer. Co-creating together not only teaches new technical skills and collaborative tactics, but the Gizmo Grant program's challenges are addressed and risk of failure are reduced.

  <h2>What do we need to work with you?</h2>
  <p>
    Currently, we have a small number of people to partner with departments. To make the best use of their time, we prioritize partners who have the following conditions around their service.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Readiness and willingness:</strong> Clear leadership on a service and an open mind to trying new methods, technologies, and org structures. Additionally, the ability to unblock commons barriers to trying new things.</li>
    <li><strong>Reach and impact:</strong> Your service is used by many people and/or very important to a vulnerable populations.</li>
    <li><strong>Priority of service:</strong> If a service is not a priority within your department, it's unlikely to get the buy-in to try new things.</li>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> To department staff, leadership, and users of your service.</li>
    <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Since we're working with you, not building for you -- we'll need half-to-full-time participation of a cross functional set of staff. This is how we coach and help. This means empowering a small groups of folks across multiple groups that is empowered to make decisions and perform relevant actions.</li>
  </ul>
