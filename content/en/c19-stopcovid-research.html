            <p>The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is working to help the government’s response to COVID-19.</p>
            <p>We are looking to speak with people living in Canada  about their experience receiving information from the government during COVID-19, and learning to protect themselves and others during this pandemic.</p>
             <p>The study will be conducted through an online video-conferencing session and should take about 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
             <p>No expertise about COVID-19 is required.</p>
