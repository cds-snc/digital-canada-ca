        <p><strong>We work and grow together.</strong></p>
        <p>Assembling teams made up of both CDS employees and your departmental staff, we pair delivery expertise with
            program and business knowledge. By adopting iterative and people-centred methods, we can find solutions that
            work. When our partnership ends, you’ll be empowered to support and continuously improve your service.</p>

            <p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
            <p>Putting people first is key to us. We want to take on service problems that make a real impact. That
                could mean reaching a lot of people in small ways, or a small group of people in big ways. The numbers
                don’t necessarily matter; the impact does.</p>

            <p>We also consider whether the problem you face is common across government. If it is, chances are another
                government department can use the solution to.</p>

            <p><strong>Success</strong></p>
            <p>We don’t own the service; you do. It’s important to us that when our partnership ends, you’re empowered
                to keep the service alive and well for those who use and depend on it. We believe products are best set
                up for success when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you’re keen to find a solution to the problem through research,</li>
                <li>your organization has dedicated staff who are eager to work through the problem,</li>
                <li>you’re excited to work iteratively and
                    learn to use people-centred methods, and</li>
                <li> you’re committed to working in the open, sharing our
                    successes and failures publicly.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Not quite ready to get started? Don’t feel like we’ve described your department perfectly? We would still
                love to hear from you.</p>
                <p>You can contact us at <a href="mailto:cds-snc@tbs-sct.gc.ca@tbs-sct.gc.ca">cds-snc@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a>.
                    We’ll set up a chat to learn
                    about your service problem and answer any questions you have about CDS.</p>
