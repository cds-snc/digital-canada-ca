            <p><strong>We work together</strong></h2>
                <p>Assembling teams made up of both CDS employees and your departmental staff, we pair our technical
                    expertise with your program and business knowledge. Let’s find solutions to the problem through
                    research and testing as a team.</p>
                <p><strong>We grow together</strong></p>
                <p>Working iteratively using people-centred methods can be hard to navigate. We’ll work closely together
                    so that when our
                    partnership ends, you’ll be empowered to support and continuously improve your service.</p>
