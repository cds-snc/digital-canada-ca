                The Canadian Digital Service is always on the lookout for new government partnerships. We work with
                federal departments and agencies across Canada to deliver simple and reliable services.

        <p><strong>We work together</strong></p>
        <p>Assembling teams made up of both CDS employees and your departmental staff, we pair delivery expertise
            with program and business knowledge. As a team, let’s find solutions to the problem through research and
            testing.</p>
        <p><strong>We grow together</strong></p>
        <p>Working iteratively using people-centred methods can be tough to navigate. We’ll work closely together so
            that when our partnership ends, you’ll be empowered to support and continuously improve your service.

            <p><strong>Reach</strong></p>
            <p>We want to take on service problems that make a real impact. This could mean reaching a lot of people
                in small ways, or a small group of people in big ways. The numbers don’t necessarily matter; the
                impact does. </p>

        <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>Readiness</strong></p>
            <p>We don’t own the service; you do. Here’s what it means to be ready:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you’re keen to find a solution to the problem together through research,</li>
                <li>your organization has dedicated staff who are eager to work through the problem,</li>
                <li>you’re excited to work iteratively and
                    learn to use people-centred methods, and</li>
                <li> you’re committed to working in the open, sharing our
                    successes and failures publicly.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-12">
            <p><strong>Replicability</strong></p>
            <p>Though not as prioritized as reach and readiness, we also consider whether the problem you face is common
                across government. If it is, chances are another government department can use the solution too.</p>
