            <p>We want to take on service problems that make a real impact. This could mean reaching a lot of people
                in small ways, or a small group of people in big ways. The numbers don’t necessarily matter; the
                impact does. </p>

            <p>We don’t own the service; you do. We believe products are most successful if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you’re keen to find a solution to the problem together through research,</li>
                <li>your organization has dedicated staff who are eager to work through the problem,</li>
                <li>you’re excited to work iteratively and
                    learn to use people-centred methods, and</li>
                <li> you’re committed to working in the open, sharing our
                    successes and failures publicly.</li>

            <p>We consider whether the problem you face is common across government. If it is, chances are another government department can use the solution too.</p>
