## We work together
Assembling teams made up of both CDS employees and your departmental staff, we pair our technical expertise with your
program and business knowledge. Let’s find solutions to the problem through research and testing as a team.
<!-- -->

## We grow together
Working iteratively using people-centred methods can be hard to navigate. We’ll work closely together so that when our
partnership ends, you’ll be empowered to support and continuously improve your service.

# How we prioritize partnerships
<!-- -->

## Reach
We want to take on service problems that make a real impact. This could mean reaching a lot of people in small ways, or
a small group of people in big ways.

<!-- -->
## Readiness
We don’t own the service; you do. Here’s what it means to be ready:
you’re keen to find a solution to the problem together through research,
your organization has dedicated staff who are eager to work through the problem,
you’re excited to work iteratively and learn to use people-centred methods, and
you’re committed to working in the open, sharing our successes and failures publicly.
