description: >-
  The purpose of this tool is to automate compliance checking for Kubernetes based applications. It assumes that certain aspects of compliance such as security and accessibility can be validated through automation, and therefore run at every deployment of the application. It leverages the introspectability of the Kubernetes cluster as well as multitude of external APIs that expose such information (ex. The GitHub API exposes data around code review).
