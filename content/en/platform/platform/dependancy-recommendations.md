  Not All dependancy packages are created equal. The dependency checker is a continuous integration tool that extracts all the javascript packages listed in your package.json files and runs them against the npms.io api. If the package score less than a 0.4 then the tool will create an issue in your repo, alerting you that you might want to review the package before using it.
