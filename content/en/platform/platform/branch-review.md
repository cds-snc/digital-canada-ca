title: Kubernetes branch reviews
translationKey: branch-reviews
description: >-
  The purpose of this tool is to create Kubernetes review (also known as staging) applications that reflect the code on a Git branch using an isolated Kubernetes cluster. This allows you to test and review your application in an interactive environment without solely relying on interpreting the code changes in a branch. We also want all this information to be easily accessible through GitHub.
