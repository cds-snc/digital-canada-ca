title: CDS Log Driver ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
translationKey: log-driver
description: >-
  Log driving is a means of moving logs (sawn tree trunks) from a forest to sawmills and pulp mills downstream using the current of a river.

  In our case we want to move logs (console messages) out of developer consoles and into places like StackDriver.
