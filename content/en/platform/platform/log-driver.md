translationKey: log-driver
description: >-
  Log driving is a means of moving logs (sawn tree trunks) from a forest to sawmills and pulp mills downstream using the current of a river. In our case we want to move logs (console messages) out of developer consoles and into places like StackDriver(Google Cloud/AWS). By storing logs in a standard centralized location it can make it easier to automatically monitor, review, query, and consult logs.
