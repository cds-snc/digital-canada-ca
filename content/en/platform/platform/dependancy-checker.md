  The dependency checker is a continuous integration tool that extracts all the javascript packages listed in your package.json files and runs them against the tool available at https://npms.io/. If the package score less than a 0.4 then the tool will create an issue in your repo, alerting you that you might want to review the package before using it. To learn more about the scoring criteria, you can review the documentation here.
