            <!-- How to report a vulnerability -->
            <h2>How to report a vulnerability</h2>
            <p>CDS is an advocate of responsible vulnerability disclosure. If you've found a vulnerability, we would like to know so we can fix it.</p>
            <h3>In your report:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You can remain anonymous.</li>
                <li>Only submit reports about an exploitable vulnerability. Do not submit reports detailing non-exploitable vulnerabilities, or reports indicating that the services do not fully align with “best practice”. For example, missing security headers, or a high volume of low-quality reports (for example, from an automated scanner).</li>
                <li>Do not communicate any vulnerabilities or associated details other than by means described in this notice.</li>
                <li>Do not expect or demand financial compensation for your research and testing to disclose vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>A non-exploitable vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Something you think could be improved - for example, missing security headers.</li>

                <li>We will prioritize fixing the vulnerability by looking at the impact, severity and exploit complexity. Vulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address.</li>
