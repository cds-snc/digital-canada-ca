            <h2>Using files located on non-Government of Canada servers</h2>
            <p>To improve the functionality of the Canadian Digital Service website, certain files (such as open source
                libraries, images and scripts) may be delivered automatically to your browser via a trusted third-party
                server or content delivery network. The delivery of these files is intended to provide a seamless user
                experience by speeding response times and avoiding the need for each visitor to download these files.
                Where applicable, specific privacy statements covering these files are included in our <a
                        href="/legal/privacy/">Privacy Notice</a>.</p>
            <h2>Providing content in Canada's official languages</h2>

                requirements establish when we use both English and French to provide services to or communicate with
                members of the public. When there is no obligation to provide information in both official languages,
                content may be available in one official language only. Information provided by organizations not
                subject to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/"><em>Official Languages Act</em></a>
                is in the language(s) provided. Information provided in a language other than English or French is only
                for the convenience of our visitors.</p>
            <h2>Linking to non-Government of Canada websites</h2>

            <h2>Social media</h2>

                social media platforms.</p>
            <h3>Content and frequency</h3>
            <p>The Canadian Digital Service uses its social media accounts as an alternative method of sharing the
                content posted on its website and interacting with stakeholders. By following the Canadian Digital
                Service's social media accounts (by "following," "liking" or "subscribing"), you can expect to see
                information about its programs and services.</p>
            <p>Because the servers of social media platforms are managed by a third party, social media accounts are
                subject to downtime that may be out of the Government of Canada's control. The Government accepts no
                responsibility for platforms becoming unresponsive or unavailable.</p>

                not responsible for the information found through these links or ads, nor does it endorse the sites or
                their content.</p>
            <h3>Accessibility of social media platforms</h3>
            <p>Social media platforms are third-party service providers and are not bound by Government of Canada
                standards for Web accessibility.</p>
            <h3>Copyright</h3>
            <p>Information posted by the Government of Canada is subject to the <a
                    href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/index.html"><em>Copyright Act</em></a>.</p>
            <h3>Privacy</h3>
            <p>Social media accounts of the Canadian Digital Service are not Government of Canada websites and represent
                only its presence on third-party service providers.</p>
            <p>For more information, please refer to our Privacy Notice regarding third-party social media.</p>
            <h3>Official languages</h3>
            <p>Many social media platforms have multiple language options and provide instructions on how to set your
                preferences. The Government of Canada respects the <a
                        href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/index.html"><em>Official Languages Act</em></a>
