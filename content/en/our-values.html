  <h2>Our Values</h2>

  <p>Our mission is to change government to serve people better. We work with
    federal partners to build better services for the public and to help public
    servants doing this important work.</p>

  <p>We strive to live these values in everything we do at CDS. They guide our
    work, shape our decisions, our behaviour, and our hiring.</p>

  <h3>Put people at the heart of our services</h3>
  <p>Our work is fundamentally about people, not technology. We’re driven by
    empathy and put people’s needs first. We build inclusivity, diversity, and
    accessibility into everything we do — from the start, not as an
    afterthought. We work hand in hand with the people who use and operate
    services.</p>

  <h3>Deliver measurable outcomes</h3>
  <p>We work to achieve the greatest impact for the greatest number of people in
    the greatest need. That means we focus on measuring how we help people and
    create lasting change in government, not project milestones. We believe
    hands-on delivery &mdash; actually designing and building services with
    partners &mdash; develops skills and gets results.</p>

  <h3>Do the hard work to make things easier</h3>
  <p>Making change in government is hard, but we love a good challenge. We do
    not shy away from hard conversations but approach them with courage,
    humility, compassion, and integrity. We untangle complexity so the people
    using government services do not have to.</p>

  <h3>Build for learning and iteration</h3>
  <p>We believe that good services are built in small steps and with modular
    parts that make it easier to pivot and course correct. The best way to find
    out if a service works well is to put it in front of the people who use it,
    so we continuously test, learn, document, and adjust.</p>

  <h3>Work in the open to help clear a path</h3>
  <p>We share our work, progress, and failures to help others learn from what we
    do. We want to show what is possible and empower public servants to make it
    a reality. We welcome the contributions and critiques that make our work
    better.</p>

  <h3>Take care of each other</h3>
  <p>We’ve got each other’s backs — and those of our partners. We treat
    resilience and wellness as organizational responsibilities, not just
    character traits. We work to create a space where people feel they belong,
    take risks, learn from mistakes, and speak openly.</p>
