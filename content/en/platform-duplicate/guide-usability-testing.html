            <h3><strong>What is usability testing?</strong></h3>

            <p>Usability testing is asking people to complete tasks and observing what happens.</p>           
            
            <h3><strong>Key elements of usability testing</strong></h3>
    
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Make a plan.</strong> Write down the purpose, participants and tasks before your start. <a href="https://www.userfocus.co.uk/pdf/usabilitydashboard.pdf">Sample one page usability testing plan.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Recruit enough people.</strong> Don’t test with one or two people and call it done. Use at least five different people of different backgrounds. <a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/01/how-to-determine-the-right-number-of-participants-for-usability-studies.php">More thoughts on how many people to include.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Choose tasks that people would actually think to complete.</strong> For example, on the CDS website, people don’t think “I want to use the job application function.” Instead, they’d think of themselves as “learning about what jobs CDS has available.”<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/better-usability-tasks/"> Task writing tips.</a></li>
                <li><strong>While facilitating tests, be quiet.</strong> Ask participants to complete a task and then be silent. Don’t coach them or react to what they do. Focus on observing what’s easy and hard.<a href="http://sensible.com/downloads/things-a-therapist-would-say.pdf"> Tips on what to say when people ask you questions.</a></li>
                <li><strong>Look for patterns across participants.</strong> Don’t start making changes based on one participant. Fix what several people struggle with. Two possible tools for doing so:<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/rainbow-spreadsheet-collaborative-ux-research-tool/">the rainbow spreadsheet</a> and the <a href="http://usabilityworks.com/consensus-on-observations-in-real-time-keeping-a-rolling-list-of-issues/">rolling issues list.</a></li>
