            <p class="bolded">The exposure notification app and its servers do not collect or store any personal
                information about you.</p>
            <p class="italic">Note: The app has not yet been released. This policy will be updated before release, to
                provide the most accurate information available.</p>

            <h2>Data the app collects & stores</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Codes randomly generated by your phone, from the last 14 days</li>
                <li>Codes randomly generated by other phones near you, from the last 14 days</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How the app protects this data</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>These random codes cannot be connected to you by the app.</li>
                <li>Your phone encrypts this data. Your phone will check with you before sharing it with the app.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The app has no way of knowing or sharing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your location</li>
                <li>Where you've been</li>
                <li>Who you've been with</li>
                <li>Your identity</li>
                <li>Your contacts</li>
                <li>Any details about the people you're near</li>
                <li>Your health information</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data the app shares</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="bolded">If you test positive for COVID-19 and enter the one-time code from your healthcare
                    service provider</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>With your permission, your randomly-generated codes from the last 14 days will be shared with the exposure notification server. This will inform people whose phones were close to you that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.</li>
                    <li>For 13 days after you report a positive test, the app will ask your permission to share your randomly-generated codes with the server, so that people you were near can be notified.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><span class="bolded">If a person you were near tests positive for COVID-19</span>, no information about you is shared with that person or the server. The matching between COVID-positive random codes and your own phone’s random codes all happens on your phone.</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Nothing is shared without your permission.</span>Even when you give permission,
                    the only information that’s shared is the random codes from your phone.</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Only the app and servers will have access to the randomly-generated codes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Deleting your data</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Randomly-generated codes from your phone and other phones within range are automatically deleted 14
                    days after they’re generated.</li>
                <li>You can uninstall the app at any time, and the codes on your phone will automatically be deleted. If you uploaded your randomly-generated codes, they will automatically delete from the servers 14 days after they were generated.</li>
            </ul>
