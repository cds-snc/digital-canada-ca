            <h2>How the data is protected</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The app cannot connect your identity with the random codes.</li>
                <li>Your phone encrypts the random codes. You must give your permission before your phone will share the random codes with COVID Alert.</li>
                <li>Nothing is shared without your explicit permission.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section--title">What the app shares</h2>
            
            <h2>Nothing is done without your permission</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Even when you give permission, the only information that’s shared is the random codes from your phone.</li>
                <li>Only the app and its servers will have access to the random codes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>If you’re diagnosed with COVID-19</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You can choose to share your random codes from the past 14 days with a central server.</li>
                <li>If you share your random codes, nobody will get any information about you or the time you were near them.</li>
                <li>You’ll also be asked for permission to upload your random codes for 13 days after.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Deleting your data</h2>
