            <p>COVID Alert follows all the principles of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada for contact tracing apps to protect people’s privacy.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The app cannot connect your identity with the random codes</li>
                <li>Your phone encrypts the random codes. You must give your permission before your phone will share the random codes with COVID Alert</li>
                <li>Nothing is shared without your explicit permission</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section--title">What the app shares</h2>
            
            <h2>Nothing is done without your permission</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Even when you give permission, the only information that’s shared is the random codes from your phone</li>
                <li>Only the app and its servers will have access to the random codes</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>You can choose to share your random codes from the past 14 days with a central server</li>
                <li>If you share your random codes, nobody will get any information about you or the time you were near them</li>
                <li>You’ll also be asked for permission to upload your random codes for 13 days after</li>
            </ul>
