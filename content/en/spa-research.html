            <p>We&rsquo;re conducting research to try to improve how businesses find opportunities to work with the public sector in Canada. This could be all levels of government, academia, or the health and social sector.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Canadian Digital Service and Public Services and Procurement Canada are trying to learn more about the experiences of businesses looking for public sector contracts. We&rsquo;d like to understand what makes a good procurement opportunity for you, and what information you need to decide to respond.</p>

            <p>By participating, you will help make it easier for businesses like yours to find relevant opportunities to respond to.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you participate, you&rsquo;ll be asked to:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
                <li>reflect on your activities related to public sector procurement&nbsp;</li>
                <li>report your experiences by email.&nbsp;</li>
