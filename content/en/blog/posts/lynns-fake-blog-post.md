Even though this is a fake blog post and no one is going to read it except the folks who are on the Outreach Team, I feel an odd amount of pressure the write something good, which as you can tell, is not going well.

This is a bulleted list of foods I enjoy:
* butter chicken
* ice cream
* cinnamon rolls
* frozen grapes
