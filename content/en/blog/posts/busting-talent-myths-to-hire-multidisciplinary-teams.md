title: Busting talent myths to hire multidisciplinary teams
description: >-
  We’ve talked about how we work in new kinds of team, but we’ve skipped over an important part: how do you build these teams in the first place? In this blog post, we’ve teamed up with the Office of the Chief Human Resource Officer (OCHRO) to answer some of the most common questions we get around hiring multidisciplinary teams.

Not long ago we talked about how we [get by with a little help from our friends](https://digital.canada.ca/2019/03/18/attracting-and-recruiting-top-talent-with-a-little-help-from-our-friends/). So we wanted to take it a step further, and share some myth busting from the Office of the Chief Human Resource Officer (OCHRO). One of the most common questions we get is around how we hire multidisciplinary teams.

We’ve talked about how we work in [new kinds of teams](https://digital.canada.ca/2018/08/21/productive-collaboration/), but we’ve skipped over an important part: how do you build these teams in the first place? Given the Government's classification system, there are some practices that have crept into our work, that some have adopted as hard and fast rules.

Our friends at OCHRO recently made an important clarification. They stated that like roles aren’t required to report to like. For instance, a content designer who is in an IS role, could report to their manager who is an interaction designer classified as a CS. As long as it makes organizational design sense, *there are no rules against it*.

Hiring managers had been sending OCHRO a lot of questions about hiring teams with different skills and needs. The office is showing leadership in removing barriers and enabling public servants.

It all starts with someone asking the question: *why not hire differently?* We often get entrenched in ways of working to reduce our risks, but sometimes they are based on an over-interpretation of policies.

We know how important it is for the government to enable hiring the right talent for the job. That’s why OCHRO has also clarified that an expert is hired at a senior but -non- executive level, and is paid at a level close to or higher than a manager. For example, a CS-5 security expert can be hired with no direct reports, reporting to their manager who is a CS-4 developer. It is important to have the right balance of technical skills and expertise on your team to do your best work. As long as these choices fit with the principles of organizational design, you can hire the experts you need.

If you have more questions about hiring, your human resource teams can help you find the right design. Clarification from OCHRO will help deepen understanding of how multidisciplinary teams can add value to your department, and how to make it happen.
