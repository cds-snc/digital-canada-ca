                   development of a nationwide exposure notification app</a>, to help Canadians stay safe and reduce
               the
               spread of COVID-19. Since then, our product teams at CDS have been working quickly to build an
               accessible, reliable, secure, and user-friendly app for people to use across the country. <span
                   class="bolded">COVID Alert
                   officially launched today – you can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/id1520284227">download
                       the iOS app</a> or <a
                       href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.gc.hcsc.canada.stopcovid">download the
                       Android app</a>.</span></p>
           <p>Our starting point was the <a href="https://www.covidshield.app/">open source code developed by
                   volunteers at Shopify</a>, which is based on <a
                   href="https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing">Apple
                   and Google’s exposure notification Bluetooth technology</a>. We’ve worked really closely with our
               friends at
               <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada.html">Health Canada</a>, at the <a
                   href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-digital-service">Ontario Digital Service</a> and with a
               number of other teams and experts inside and
               outside government.</p>
           <p>From that starting point, we’ve made a wide range of changes to improve the accessibility and reliability
               of the app, and to make sure that it works well with Apple and Google’s underlying systems. We’ve also
               done usability testing, small- and large-scale <a
                   href="https://twitter.com/CDS_GC/status/1285771764900012032">beta testing</a>, and other design
               research activities to
               make sure that the app’s design and content are easy for people to use and understand.</p>
           <p>We’re building COVID Alert in the open, and you can follow our development work in real time on our
               GitHub repositories <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-mobile">for the mobile app</a>, <a
                   href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-server">for the server software that supports it</a>,
               and <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-healthcare-portal">for the optional
                   healthcare portal</a> that provinces and territories can use to generate one-time keys for
               COVID-positive
               patients. Provinces and territories can also connect their healthcare IT systems directly to the server
               software via API, to generate one-time keys automatically.</p>
           <p>For anyone who is curious, here are a few of the recent changes we’ve made throughout the app.</p>
            <h2>Accessibility improvements</h2>
           <p>Making sure that our services work for everyone is one of our main goals in the Government of Canada. Our
               CDS <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/a11y/">Accessibility Handbook</a> outlines how we do this,
               although most of our work is usually focused on
               online services. For the COVID Alert app, diving into accessibility for mobile applications has been
               good practice for our team. There’s some great resources that we’ve used along the way:</p>
           <ul>
               <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Mobile_accessibility_checklist">Mozilla’s
                       Mobile accessibility checklist</a></li>
               <li><a href="https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/guides/smartphone-accessibility/">Uswitch’s Smartphone
                       accessibility: a comprehensive guide</a></li>

                       accessibility during COVID-19 from the Digital Transformation Office</a></li>
           </ul>
           <p>Some of the improvements that we’ve made to COVID Alert based on accessibility testing include VoiceOver
               and TalkBack (screenreader) capabilities, voice control options, support for higher-zoom text sizes and
               magnification, focus changes for navigation, contrast inversion support, immersive reading options, and
               colour contrast fixes. You can see <a

                   accessibility issues on our GitHub issue tracker for
                   the app.</a></p>
           <p>Making sure that COVID Alert is accessible to everyone with an Apple or Android phone is our top
               priority. We’re really grateful to Health Canada’s accessibility team and developers from Shopify who
               have worked alongside our product team. You can read our <a

                   Statement</a> for the app here, and
               see the <a

           <h2>More robust one-time keys</h2>
           <p>One of the “key” parts of the exposure notification system is the one-time keys that are used to confirm
               a positive COVID-19 diagnosis within the app. These one-time keys are provided by provincial and
               territorial public health care authorities to COVID-positive individuals, who can then enter them into
               COVID Alert. They exist to make sure that only valid positive results are used to send exposure
               notifications.</p>
           <p>After someone enters a one-time key, they can consent to upload their phone’s random Bluetooth codes to
               the key server. These codes are then retrieved by other people’s phones with the app installed, to alert
               them that they were in contact with someone who was COVID-positive.</p>
           <p>Originally, these one-time keys were an 8-digit set of numbers, with an expiry value of 10 minutes. We
               realized early on that a 10-minute countdown could be overwhelming to people – particularly as they
               would be dealing with a COVID diagnosis – so we decided to extend this expiry to 24 hours, to give
               people time to process, and make an informed decision, when they were ready.</p>
           <p>Because of this, we needed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing)">more entropy</a>
               to make sure that these keys were secure. We switched to <a
                   href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-server/pull/197">a new
                   10-digit alphanumeric pattern</a>, and we structured the codes into groups of letters or numbers to
               make it
               easier to read. </p>
           <p>The letters and numbers we use for the new pattern are “AEFHJKLQRSUWXYZ - 2456789”. Why those? It avoids
               numbers and letters that might cause confusion when they’re read on a screen or communicated over the
               phone (for example, the letter O versus the number 0) before people enter them into COVID Alert.</p>
            <h2>Precise privacy language</h2>
            <div class="flex-blog">
               <div class="flex-text">
                   <p>The COVID Alert app and the Apple/Google Bluetooth technology that it runs on have been carefully
                       designed to maximize people’s privacy. The app doesn’t have any way of knowing your location,
                       your name or address, your phone contacts, your health information, or the health information of
                       anyone you’re near. When you get an alert that you were exposed to someone with COVID-19,
                       neither you nor the app can tell who that person was. This <a href="https://github.com/DP-3T/documents#dp3t---decentralized-privacy-preserving-proximity-tracing">decentralized, privacy-preserving exposure notification approach</a> has been adopted by a number of countries around the world,
                       including <a href="https://github.com/HSEIreland/covid-tracker-app">Ireland</a>, <a href="https://github.com/corona-warn-app">Germany</a>, <a href="https://github.com/immuni-app">Italy</a>, and others.</p>
                   <p>Throughout the development of COVID Alert, we’ve worked really closely with our colleagues in

                       Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC).</p>
                   <p>Part of the OPC’s feedback on initial versions of the app was that we used the word “anonymous”
                       to describe how the app works and what information it collects. “Anonymous” implies that there
                       is no risk whatsoever that a person could be identified, however, and although we all agreed
                       that while there’s a very, very low risk that someone could be re-identified through the app, it
                       isn’t necessarily zero. Someone living in a remote area and only interacting with one or two
                       other people could theoretically be identified by their neighbours if they received exposure
                       notification alerts, for example.</p>

            <hr>
           <p>Since we started working on COVID Alert, we’ve made more than 2300 commits, opened more than 370
               technical issues, and resolved more than 310 of them on our GitHub repositories (including 70 resolved
               issues that were accessibility-related). It’s been a busy time! Each of those commits is a fix or
               improvement to the app or the supporting pieces of software that make it work.</p>
           <p>Throughout the app, and throughout the web pages and other materials supporting it, we’ve reviewed and
               edited the content to make it clear, accessible, and inclusive as possible for users all across Canada.
               We’ll keep on collecting feedback to improve this content as well.</p>
           <p>We’re excited to share the app with everyone in Canada today. You can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/id1520284227">download it here for iOS</a>, or
               <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.gc.hcsc.canada.stopcovid">download it here for Android</a>. This is not the end of our work – we’re looking forward to the feedback
               we’ll get from people using the app, to continuously improve it post-launch as we all join the fight to
               stop the spread of this virus.</p>
