### Our area of operations 

As the Partnerships business area, we’re the bridge and capacity builders at CDS. We move at the speed of trust, with willing partners, who fundamentally want to change how they design and deliver public services. 

We look for opportunities to help government departments improve how they deliver public services, and assess their potential, to prioritize the work we take on. We work to grow the organization’s public sector network and knowledge of federal services, and build empathy by listening to and learning from public servants at home and abroad. 

Once we better understand a department and their service(s), we design and deliver partnership engagements, to meet them where they are, and help them improve how they design and deliver their services. To help CDS deliver the greatest public value, we work with departmental leadership, service owners, and our colleagues to set up and support CDS engagements through all phases of delivery. 

### The role 

Partnership development advisors are members of the partnership development community, and are responsible for making sure CDS develops strong relationships with Government of Canada service owners and their teams, during all phases of delivery. They do this by helping to set expectations and draft agreements to ensure smooth working relationships between CDS and our partners, by working alongside their team to develop and nurture relationships with the partner organization, and by relentlessly advocating for approaches and tactics that will deliver the greatest public value. Partnership advisors serve as members on a variety of different types of teams and may assist with conducting pre-discoveries, providing advice and guidance, service design and delivery as embedded members of a departmental partnership team, and the design, development and operation of platform services for government departments to use.

You will report to the Head of Partnership Development, who in turn reports to the Director of Partnerships. The Partnership Advisor role is classified as an EC-06, in the Economics and Social Sciences group. 

**You’ll need to accomplish the following things:**

* Work with the Director of Partnerships to establish the outcomes, approach, timeline and supporting agreement for partnership engagements. 
* Negotiate and secure agreements with the partner department for elements of our work (including access to people, resources and other work).
* Develop an approach for stakeholder engagement, communication and alignment, with the partner department, including stakeholder mapping, with help from service designers and policy analysts. 
* Monitor the health of the partnership, and communicate team plans, progress and blockers to the Director of Partnerships.
* Work with the service owner to set roles and responsibilities, facilitate coaching and provide support as their dedicated contact through all phases of delivery. 
* Coordinate briefings, with help from the product manager (internal, to the partner assistant deputy minister monthly, ministerial), and work with Outreach to update the website to reflect new partnerships.
* Based on lessons learned through our partnership engagements, generate recommendations about whether to continue, iterate on our approach, or end a partnership, for consideration by the Director of Partnerships.  

**An excellent candidate will:**

* Have a passion for making government better and understand how technology and design can help do that
* Be a people person who is self-aware, genuine, tactful, and persuasive
* Listen to learn and communicate quickly and effectively 
* Be a creative thinker who uses research to improve your understanding, breaks down problems and finds opportunities 
* Have experience making reasoned recommendations, defending difficult decisions and providing advice to senior leaders in the public and private sectors
* Remain calm under pressure, know how to prioritize, and work as part of a team
* Be fluent in French and English (in government speak, we’re looking for CBC)
