The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is tasked with changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services, to reduce the risk of product failure, lower costs, ensure user privacy and system security, and, above all, improves people’s lives by putting their needs and concerns front and center. We believe every experience Canadians have with their government should meet or exceed their reasonable modern expectations that digital services be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. Working in the open, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

We’re hiring for a Policy Advisor. While we have locations in Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, and Kitchener; we largely work distributedly and equally value candidates in other parts of Canada.

The policy team is CDS’s bureaucracy hackers and government navigators, enabling digital delivery with our partners and beyond. 

Policy advisors form part of CDS’s multidisciplinary product teams, working alongside product managers, developers, designers, and design researchers. We help build and improve government services by working through legislative, regulatory, and policy issues in product development. We dig into processes to find creative solutions. 

We also help build products and services that turn one-time fixes into replicable solutions, like [GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca), the Government of Canada’s (GC) notification service. We drive lessons from delivery into policy and standards-setting, advocating for changes that make it easier to do the right thing. 

Policy Advisors are classified as EC-04 and EC-05 in the Economics and Social Science Services group in the Treasury Board Secretariat of the Government of Canada.

Our goal is to scale modern service design and development practices across government — in order to produce better outcomes for the public — by helping to change the relationship between policy and delivery. 

## Why join the CDS Policy team? 

In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to work with colleagues with diverse skills and experience. You’ll learn about service design and software development, as a member of multidisciplinary teams doing that work every day to better serve people and businesses across Canada. You’ll flex your problem-solving abilities on issues like privacy, equity, design research, and procurement, and the adoption of modern tools. You’ll help connect  CDS’s work with Cabinet, ministers, and senior officials to scale its impact. 
 
## In this role, you will have the opportunity to:

- Serve on CDS product and service teams, to help navigate government legislation, regulation, policies and processes to enable delivery
- Take practical delivery lessons and work with colleagues across the government to drive changes to rules, practices and governance that help scale iterative software development and human-centred design across government
- Develop policy proposals to advance CDS’s mandate and mission  
- Research and connect the dots between government services and other areas of digital policy, such as access to broadband Internet, data management and policy, or technology and sustainability
- Help build effective relationships within the federal government, Officers of Parliament, other levels of government, other countries, and other sectors
- Help measure the impact CDS is having
 
## Skills we’re looking for:

- You want to make government better, and have ideas on how technology and design can contribute to that
- You’re a strong researcher and creative problem-solver -- and enjoy digging into topics to generate advice and solutions
- You’re good at cultivating interpersonal relationships and enthusiastic about working collaboratively, across diverse skill-sets and experiences 
- You understand (or want to understand) how stuff gets done in government
- You’re action oriented and comfortable identifying priorities and managing your time independently, with the support of your manager and team
- You’re able to effectively navigate uncertainty and change to achieve project goals
- You’re a quick learner and an effective communicator, both written and verbally 
- You’re motivated to [work in the open](https://digital.canada.ca/2020/02/24/why-open-source-matters/), and help colleagues do the same
