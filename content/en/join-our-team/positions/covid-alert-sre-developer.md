The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) works to change government so that it can serve people better through digital technology. Our teams work in the open to build software platforms that make it easier for government to deliver services and coach other government departments on how to leverage modern methods and technologies. We need you.

To support this important mission, we are hiring a SRE Developer to support the COVID Alert App. This position is in the [Computer Systems classification](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=1#toc12259212260), representing the [CS qualification standard](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/staffing/qualification-standards/core.html#cs).

## All candidates will be evaluated based on their experiences:

* Developing, deploying, and operating services using major cloud tools 
* Employing site reliability and software development practices
* Deliver solutions and processes iteratively
* Using automation and monitoring tools to reduce toil and surface issues
* Working in highly variable, highly visible, multi-stakeholder environments in the open
* Advising product team members, including non-developers
* Promoting inclusive delivery and upholding impact, openness, integrity and fairness.

While we have locations in Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, and Kitchener; we largely work distributedly and equally consider candidates in other parts of Canada.

Reporting to the Head of Software Development, this position is supporting the COVID Alert business unit, which makes a mobile application that notifies people living in Canada if they may have come in contact with the virus, with the ultimate goal of slowing the spread of COVID-19. 

## You’ll need to accomplish the following things:

* Design, build, configure, and improve infrastructure as code for COVID Alert products to enable deploying rapidly, scaling gracefully, and keeping system data safe.
* Apply security best practices and complete compliance paperwork to keep cloud infrastructure and tools safe for users and those they support.
* Participate, lead, and document incident post-mortems when something goes wrong, so that teams and products can improve going forward.
* Optimize cloud cost and reduce system resource usage by setting clear requirements through efficiency and capacity planning.
* Contribute code for new backend features on COVID Alert Server and COVID Alert Portal as needed.
* Identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks inside our continuous integration / continous deployment pipelines, monitoring capabilities, and cloud infrastructure.

We recognize that everyone brings skills and experiences to the table and that not everyone “checks all the boxes”. Apply anyway! Tell us why you’re the right fit for the job.

At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve.
