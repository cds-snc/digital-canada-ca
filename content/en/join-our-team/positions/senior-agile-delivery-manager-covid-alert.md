The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is tasked with changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services, to reduce the risk of product failure, lower costs, ensure user privacy and system security, and, above all, improves people’s lives by putting their needs and concerns front and center. We believe every experience Canadians have with their government should meet or exceed their reasonable modern expectations that digital services be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. Working in the open, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

We’re hiring for a Senior Agile Delivery Manager. While we have locations in Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, and Kitchener; we largely work distributedly and equally value candidates in other parts of Canada.

We’re a matrixed organization with communities of practice that staff people across our business units. Those units include Partnerships, providing hands on consulting with other departments, Platforms, building and operating reusable software services and Covid Alert, improving and maintaining the live service of Covid Alert together with Health Canada. This position will report to the Head of Product and Delivery Management Community, but will be assigned to the Covid Alert unit to oversee the delivery of its different teams. 

Senior Agile Delivery Managers are classified as [CS-04](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=1#toc12259212260/) in the Computer Systems group in the Treasury Board Secretariat of the Government of Canada. 

## You’ll need to accomplish the following things:

1. Oversee the work of different product teams and optimize delivery practices, processes and communication channels in a changing and complex environment
2. Align multi-disciplinary team members around a team's mission and ensure that efforts are leading to desired, measurable outcomes
3. Together with the product teams, build and maintain relationships with internal and external stakeholders based on trust, openness and collaboration 
4. Provide guidance on agile rituals, organization, and may support with facilitation; organize and facilitate working sessions with stakeholders
5. Create strategies to mitigate delivery risks; efficiently protect product teams from outside distractions and interruptions
6. Monitor trends in both the team’s health, as well as capacity and proactively take action in order to maintain both dimensions at an optimal and sustainable level
7. Advocate for and apply agile methodologies’ best practices based on the context of the team and the business unit; carry out agile training activities both at CDS and across government
8. Lead by example in demonstrating a culture of learning, wellbeing and transparency through rigorous behaviours

## We’ll evaluate you based on your:

1. Knowledge of and experience in the agile delivery management practice, especially in ambiguous and multi-stakeholder environments
2. Ability to coordinate and motivate multiple teams of developers, designers and researchers, with experience of having worked in similar roles and teams previously
3. Creativity and passion for problem-solving and for risk mitigation to maximize the efficiency of teams
4. Experience of leading the development, release and continuous improvement of digital services through different stages of delivery
5. Ability to build trustworthy relationships with stakeholders and peers and adapt your approach with each of them 
6. Habits of being organized, taking action, learning through doing and helping others to achieve their goals and develop their potential
7. Ability to promote inclusive delivery, and to uphold impact, openness, integrity and fairness.

## Covid Alert

You'll join CDS's COVID Alert business unit, which is focused on providing Canadian residents notifications when they may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. There are several teams within COVID Alert, all composed of multi-disciplinary teams of digital practitioners. Work is spread across several areas: the mobile application; web portals for healthcare systems and business to facilitate notification sending; and the backend that enables anonymous data collection and metrics. Your work is an emergency measure that will be used by millions in the effort to reduce the negative impacts of the pandemic.

COVID Alert has a complex web of stakeholders that influence its direction because of its importance and visibility. We try to work like a typical agile product delivery team as much as possible, but are heavily influenced by the ways of working of our partners and this sometimes means changes in priorities. To work on this project, you'll have to be ready for pivots and prioritization decisions that might change what you're working on without much notice.

At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we can recognize and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.

CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments. We are committed to providing an inclusive and barrier-free work environment, starting with the hiring process.
