The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is tasked with changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services, to reduce the risk of product failure, lower costs, ensure user privacy and system security, and, above all, improves people’s lives by putting their needs and concerns front and center. We believe every experience Canadians have with their government should meet or exceed their reasonable modern expectations that digital services be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. Working in the open, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

We’re hiring an Executive Assistant to provide administrative and operational support to senior leaders, classified as AS-02 in the Administrative Services group. This position will report to the Chief of Staff to the CEO.

We are looking for an Executive Assistant who will thrive at managing multiple priorities in a rapidly changing environment, as they work alongside our community of practice Directors and their teams. This is a multi-faceted role that goes beyond traditional administration and correspondence and will provide the opportunity to grow skills in strategy, stakeholder engagement, work management, and policy. CDS uses modern tools to help you get the job done, provides mentorship, coaching and professional development opportunities as well as experience seeing how modern software and digital services are built. If you’re ready to work and learn as part of a caring, mission-driven, fast-paced team; help CDS continuously fine-tune their operations; and play a part in improving services for Canadians, this is the role for you.

## We’re looking for someone who will:
- Manage calendars and logistics for internal and external meetings, as well as future travel.
- Draft and manage correspondence and communications on behalf of Directors.
- Plan and execute team events, meetings, off-sites, and other special functions.
- Track, organize, and prioritize a range of action items, approval requests, and internal documents from staff.
- Ensure that all meetings have clear agendas and materials are provided in advance
- Interact with stakeholders and help connect them with the right people at CDS
- Act as a liaison both internally and externally, maintaining a sense of professionalism and collaboration at all times.
- Create clarity and structure while working with senior leaders, helping them operationalize their strategic priorities.
- Be responsible for occasional note-taking and follow up on actions
- Remain calm under pressure, know how to prioritize, and work as part of a team.
- Work closely with Business Unit directors, and the offices of operational partners across the Treasury Board Secretariat.
- Populate Client Relationship management (CRM) systems

## An excellent candidate will be able to:
- Keep Directors on track to meet commitments and support accountability for results across the team.
- Create and improve processes and systems for prioritization and tracking.
- Think on their feet, providing interpretation and advice for Directors as they engage partners and stakeholders inside and outside government.
- Find creative solutions to problems and make sound judgement calls when faced with uncertainty or incomplete information. 
- Collaborate and co-create with partners and stakeholders.
- Be proficient in Microsoft Office, Google Apps (particularly GMail, Calendar, and Docs), and Trello. 
- Understand how government works and the systems used to run it — with an ability to manage and navigate bureaucracy with ease.
- Communicate fluently in French and English (in government speak, this role is CBC).
- Ability to draft correspondence in both official languages and to review translations would be an asset.
