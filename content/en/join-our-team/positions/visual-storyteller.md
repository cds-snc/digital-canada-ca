We’re transforming government. Our products will impact people’s everyday lives. It’s an exciting thing to be part of. We need you.

The Canadian Digital Service is focused on delivering better public services using the best technology and design, all informed by people’s needs. We’re hiring people at all levels of experience in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, and Montreal.

As the Outreach Team, we are the storytellers of the CDS. We tell the stories that help public servants improve government services and make people’s lives better. If you’re ready to help us use fewer words and more pictures, then this is the role for you. 

## We’re looking for someone who will:

* Help us tell our stories visually — whether that’s with photos, illustrations, animations, or video. We don’t need you to be an expert at all the things. We’re looking for someone who is really good at one or two of these things and interested in getting better at the rest.
* Get to know our audiences and find just the right images to help them feel something.
* Craft great still and moving images that make our blog, social media accounts, presentations, website, and posters… better.
* Experiment with us. We’re just getting started, and we’re looking for someone who can learn with us as we develop our brand and our style.
* Tell stories in French.

## You’ll fit right in if:

* Your first question is always, “Who is your audience, and what do you want them to feel?”
* You’re a creative storyteller who can make people cry, laugh, or sit in wonder with the images you create.
* You know your way around cameras, art supplies, and illustration, animation, and/or photo and video editing software.
* You love learning a new camera or illustration app, and you keep a journal, sketchbook, or Instagram account of all things creative.
* Your default mode is open collaboration. You listen and make space for new ideas.
* Your secret power is making other people’s ideas better.
* You know that sometimes just trying something is the best way to find out if it’ll work
* You’re comfortable with what you know, comfortable with what you don’t know, and know how to work with others to make great things.
* You know that done is better than perfect.
* You’re fluent in French and English. (In government speak, CBC.)
* You like ice cream. Not because we’re breaking a sweat and need to chill. Just because we like to have our team meetings over cones. (Vegan? Lactose intolerant? We’ve got you covered.)

We recognize that everyone brings skills and experiences to the table and that not everyone “checks all the boxes”. Apply anyway! Tell us why you’re the right fit for the job.

## At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it.

We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. We will only be able to deliver better, more accessible, and more inclusive public services if we harness diverse thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.

CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, Veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments.
