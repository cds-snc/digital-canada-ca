The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) works with federal departments to make the services people depend on simple and easy-to-use. We’re a small but mighty team that is rethinking service design and delivery, engaging users every step of the way. By working in the open, and connecting partners with tools, talent, and training grounded in practice, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

We’re looking for someone to lead our engineering team. As the head of engineering, you’ll set the vision and tone, shape our technical direction and choices, assess our needs and recruit to fulfill them, and support the team’s learning and development. You and your team will help ensure CDS and its partners are building meaningful, accessible, inclusive, and secure services, in the open, and help those partners prepare to own, maintain and continuously improve the services we deliver with them. You’ll drive CDS and its partners to take advantage of and develop reusable code, tools, and resources. You’ll advise partners across government on hard technology decisions, bringing agile practices and culture to legacy systems. You’ll solve technology roadblocks while navigating the rules — and help us rewrite those rules when necessary to modernize how government accommodates delivery. You’ll push the limits of what’s possible for a government that serves 37 million people.

### What we’re looking for:

* You apply the right tools to solve problems. You have experience working in Lean, agile, or other fast-moving environments, where you’ve deployed open source and cloud technologies at scale.
* You have what it takes to build and lead a high-performing engineering team that’s engaged in several projects at a time. You engage well with others, internally and externally. You inspire collaboration and creativity and can communicate effectively with technical and non-technical audiences alike.
* You have a vision for what engineering in and for government can and should be, and a bias toward action. You have an appetite for challenging the status quo, you can articulate clearly the differences between technology fact and FUD, and you understand the complexities of service delivery in large organizations.
* You advocate for the people you serve. You build with people, rather than for them, integrating data and user experiences. You are passionate about making Canada a better place and strive to deliver user-centred products.

### An excellent candidate will be able to:

* Lead your team to design, build, and operate critical systems.
* Set and continuously improve a high-performing, inclusive, team-first development culture and foster team leaders who will do the same.
* Recruit, interview, hire, cultivate and support diverse engineering teams that reflect and represent the best of Canada.
* Collaborate with partners and stakeholders.
* Promote innovation and guide technological change at CDS and with our government partners.
* Learn from failure.
* Achieve results.
* Model a culture of inclusive delivery and uphold principles of openness, integrity and fairness.

At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we can recognise and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.

CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments.
