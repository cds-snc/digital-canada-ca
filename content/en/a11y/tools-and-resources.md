At the Canadian Digital Service (CDS), we use a variety of testing tools, including:

- Research with people with disabilities
- Automated testing tools
- Adaptive technology
- Manual testing and
- Usability testing including people with disabilities.

## Automated testing

For automated testing, CDS uses a range of tools, including:

- [accessibilityinsights.io](https://accessibilityinsights.io/)
- [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [Siteimprove](https://siteimprove.com/en-ca/core-platform/integrations/browser-extensions/)
- [WAVE Toolbar](https://wave.webaim.org/)
- [Google Chrome - Accessibility Developer Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/accessibility-developer-t/fpkknkljclfencbdbgkenhalefipecmb?hl=en)

**Pa11y / Puppeteer** is a [NodeJS (JavaScript) Library](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y) for automating Google&#39;s Chrome &amp; Chromium Web Browser. The reason we choose this library over another tool such as selenium was purely due to ease of use.

We found that Puppeteer was easier for our devs to use then other alternatives. This also allowed use to automate certain functionality that can be difficult to test for single page apps and dynamically generated content.

**aXe Core** was selected due to the updates towards WCAG 2.1 automated testing scoring and due to their partnership with Microsoft&#39;s accessibility.insights.io tool which allows more detailed walk throughs in the manual testing arena. aXe is also commitment to producing little to no-false positives and has partnered with government, industry and other accessibility leaders as the engine for automation tools. It is also used by Google for their in-browser and cli a11y automation tool Lighthouse. It also was very easy to integrate with Puppeteer, Jira and Github.

## Manual testing

Use [the accessibility checklist created by 18F](https://accessibility.18f.gov/checklist/) (the US government&#39;s digital agency) to help you test for common accessibility problems, including:

- lack of keyboard accessibility (important because people who use screen readers, voice recognition or have situational, temporary of permanent mobility related disabilities may rely on using a keyboard to navigate websites)
- ensure that the content is written in plain language
- link text that&#39;s not descriptive (for example, &#39;click here&#39; and &#39;read more&#39; links)
- lack of colour contrast for text and important graphics or lack of proper controls
- non decorative images not having meaningful alt text
- [Online forms](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) not being marked up correctly, so the right control is associated with the right label

Some browsers have tools that make it easier to find accessibility problems in the Document Object Model (DOM). For example, [accessibility Inspector for Mozilla Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector) and the [accessibility features in Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/accessibility/reference). Also, you can check out the [Accessibility Object  Model](https://wicg.github.io/aom/).

## Cross-browser testing

For cross-browser testing, ensure your service works on the following browsers:

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/)
- Windows only: [Internet Explorer 11](https://www.microsoft.com/download/internet-explorer.aspx), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge)
- Mac/iOS only: [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)
