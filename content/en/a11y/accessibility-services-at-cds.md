CDS provides  Accessibility Services specifically for CDS teams.

If you work at CDS,  you can use our internal Accessibility Services.  These include:

- High-level report that reviews baseline compliance, as well as whether your product meets CDS’s accessibility commitment. We adapted a checklist from 18F, updated it to reference WCAG 2.1 AA standards, and revised the 18F check points to better meet the needs of Canadians. You can learn more about Priority Checks in [“How to Make it Accessible”] (/how-to-make-it-accessible/).

- Detailed accessibility audit with full report on the issues identified, how these relate to accessibility, and your next steps to fix these and any related issues.

- Accessibility clinics, either customized for your product or a specific topic, or generally on accessibility and inclusive design.

- Demonstration of a manual review for accessibility testing such as keyboard navigation, behaviours, use of colour, correctly implementing ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), etc.

- Paired accessibility review.

## Allow time for analysis

- Please request Accessibility Services at least 3 weeks before your deadline.

- If you request a high-level report, you should receive the report in 5-7 business days.

- If you request a detailed accessibility audit, you should receive the audit results in 10-14 business days.
