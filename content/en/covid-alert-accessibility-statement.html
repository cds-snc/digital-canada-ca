            <p>COVID Alert supports common adaptive technologies. It works across the range of phones supported by <a href="https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing">Google and Apple exposure notification technology</a>, as long as the phone has at least an Android 6 or Apple iOS 13.5 operating system.</p>

            <h2>Known issues</h2>
            <p>The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) conducted research, inclusive design reviews and followed best practices for clear language, inclusive design and compatibility with adaptive technology. Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19GKk7gTkmUkJL5Gz6T4PeOvFTOQSJKlmI44ttoL7jTg/edit#heading=h.rdzm94t2zs83">latest accessibility report</a> outlines current accessibility issues with COVID Alert, as well as recommended adaptations.</p>
            <p>[More about what adaptive tech is and is not currently supported. If most things are supported the current approach is fine. But if we know there are significant gaps we should just be up front and transparent about it, and plan to edit the page when they’re resolved.]</p>
            <p>We’re committed to working in the open and to continuously improving the COVID Alert app. You can follow our work in real-time and review the latest technical issues in our <a href="https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-shield-mobile/issues">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
