            <p>The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is working to help the government’s response to COVID-19. We are conducting research in the upcoming weeks to inform the national COVID app. Particularly, on the healthcare worker experience when accessing and sharing information with people who test positive for COVID-19. The studies will be conducted through phone or video-conference and should take about 15-30 minutes.</p>
