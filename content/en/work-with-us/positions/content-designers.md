Content designers turn difficult concepts into easy to understand content. They shape and craft all content present in a product or service. This ranges from the exact language and words on a page, to the macro-level context of how to design content for new products and services in Government. Content designers focus on the hierarchy, flow, and structure of information to achieve better user experiences. They are in constant collaboration with service designers, visual designers, interaction designers, and researchers. 

We are currently hiring in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, and Montreal.

## We’re looking for dedicated Designers to join our team:

* Your approach to design starts with inclusivity and accessibility.
* You’re great at communicating with people who aren’t familiar with design, comfortable working alongside clients during the design process, and are excited to work with people on research and testing.
* You can effectively demonstrate what your detailed design process entails.
* You are passionate about users’ experiences and want to create measurable improvements to government services.
* You have experience working alongside developers and researchers and rapidly prototyping.
