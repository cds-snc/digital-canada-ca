The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) works with federal departments to make the services people depend on simple and easy-to-use. We’re a small but mighty team that is rethinking service design and delivery, engaging users every step of the way. By working in the open and connecting partners with tools, talent, and training grounded in best practices, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

Interaction designers work out the best way to let users interact with services, both in terms of overall flow and at the level of individual design elements.

They are responsible for creating intelligent, simple interactions that allow users to achieve their goals quickly and easily. Interaction designers collaborate extensively with developers, should be comfortable with code (HTML, CSS, GitHub), and able to rapidly develop low and high-fidelity prototypes. Interaction designers also observe and interpret user interactions during usability testing and help translate research insights into design requirements. 

We are currently hiring in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, and Montreal.

## We’re looking for dedicated Designers to join our team:

* Your approach to design starts with inclusivity and accessibility
* You’re great at communicating with people who aren’t familiar with design, comfortable working alongside clients during the design process, and are excited to work with people on research and testing
* You can effectively demonstrate what your detailed design process entails
* You are passionate about users’ experiences and want to create measurable improvements to government services
* You have experience working alongside developers and researchers, and rapidly prototyping

At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we recognize and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.

CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, or family commitments.
