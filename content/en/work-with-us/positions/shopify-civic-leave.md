The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) works with federal organizations to make the services people depend on simple and easy-to-use. We’re a small but mighty team that is rethinking service design and delivery, engaging users every step of the way. By working in the open, and connecting partners with tools, talent, and training grounded in practice, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

We’ve recently collaborated with Shopify on a unique “Civic Leave” program and are now accepting applications for Developers, Designers, and Design Researchers in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, and Montreal.

## At CDS, you will be able to:

* Contribute to designing, building, and operating critical systems at scale.
* Work in a learning environment through multi-disciplinary teams with designers, researchers, developers, product managers, and policy professionals.
* Promote a high-performing, inclusive, team-first development culture.
* Collaborate with partners and stakeholders.
* Contribute to open source projects and share your work on GitHub or other public code repositories.
* Promote innovation and guide technological change at CDS and with our government partners.

Here are some of the specific skill sets we are seeking:

## DEVELOPERS

* You have a passion and skill for delivering high-quality code, in languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Python, Go, and you’ve worked with technologies like NodeJS, React, Angular, Serverless, etc.
* You’re comfortable building APIs in a RESTful style or with GraphQL.
* You apply the right tools to solve problems. You’re used to working on an agile team, in sprints, constantly iterating, and are excited about Test-Driven Development.
* You engage well with others, internally and externally. You inspire collaboration and creativity and can communicate effectively with technical and non-technical audiences alike.
* You advocate for the people you serve. You build with people, rather than for them, integrating data and user experiences. 

## DESIGNERS

* Your approach to design starts with inclusivity and accessibility.
* You’re great at communicating with people who aren’t familiar with design, comfortable working alongside clients during the design process, and are excited to work with people on research and testing.
* You can effectively demonstrate what your detailed design process entails.
* You are passionate about users’ experiences and want to create measurable improvements to government services.
* You have experience working alongside developers and researchers and rapidly prototyping.

## DESIGN RESEARCHERS

* You conduct compelling research that drives product decisions. You lead discovery interviews, observation, and analysis of existing data. You scope research plans that will lead to both short-term and long-term successes.
* You bring users’ voices and perspectives into the service conversation. You choose research methods that elicit the users’ contexts and lived experiences.
* You plan and conduct usability tests, and other lightweight research methods, all in an agile environment.
* You champion user research as a key part of the product development process for our partners. You present research to skeptical audiences and help partners build their own research capabilities.
* You reflect on your research practice. You think about what could make your research more useful, ethical, and efficient. You’re also always thinking about how to improve our products and our processes.

We recognize that everyone brings skills and experiences to the table and that not everyone “checks all the boxes”. Maybe you touch on a hybrid of these skills - apply anyway! Tell us why you’re a perfect match to help us at CDS.

## At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it.

We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. We will only be able to deliver better, more accessible, and more inclusive public services if we harness diverse thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive. CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, Veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments.
