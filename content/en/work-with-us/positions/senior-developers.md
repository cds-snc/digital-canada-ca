The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) works with federal departments to make the services people depend on simple and easy-to-use. We’re a small but mighty team that is rethinking service design and delivery, engaging users every step of the way. By working in the open and connecting partners with tools, talent, and training grounded in best practices, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

By working in the open, and connecting partners with tools, talent, and training grounded in practice, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery.

We are currently hiring in Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, and Montreal.

## We’re looking for dedicated Senior Developers to join our team.

* You have a passion and skill for delivering high-quality code, in languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Python, Go, and you’ve worked with technologies like NodeJS, React, Angular, Serverless, etc.
* You’re comfortable building APIs in a RESTful style or with GraphQL.
* You apply the right tools to solve problems. You’re used to working on an agile team, in sprints, constantly iterating, and are excited about Test-Driven Development.
* You engage well with others, internally and externally. You inspire collaboration and creativity and can communicate effectively with technical and non-technical audiences alike.
* You advocate for the people you serve. You build with people, rather than for them, integrating data and user experiences. You are passionate about making Canada a better place and strive to deliver user-centred products.

## You will be able to:

* Contribute to designing, building, and operating critical systems at scale.
* Work in a learning environment through multi-disciplinary teams with designers, researchers, and policy professionals.
* Promote a high-performing, inclusive, team-first development culture.
* Collaborate with partners and stakeholders.

* Promote innovation and guide technological change at CDS and with our government partners.
* Expand a culture of inclusive delivery and uphold principles of openness, integrity and fairness.

## At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. 

We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. We will only deliver better, more accessible, and more inclusive public services if we harness diverse thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.

CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments.
