            <h3><strong>Principles</strong></h3>
            <h4>Here are some things that CDS believes about evaluation:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Every delivery is subject to evaluation. Evaluation is a constant in the product delivery lifecycle;
                    it takes place in every story, sprint and every phase.</li>
                <li>We evaluate to make decisions, understand our progress, and demonstrate our return on investment.
                </li>
                <li>Evaluation covers delivery, product performance, partner capacity and outcomes.</li>
                <li>Every delivery team does evaluation. Not all products are alike; delivery teams decide what’s best
                    based on needs, service, phase, partner, solution, time. We make hypotheses about evaluation, and
                    iterate as we learn.</li>
                <li>There are people in teams who lead on evaluation but it’s a multidisciplinary effort.</li>
                <li>Evaluation is a collaborative activity with partners. It’s one of the things we hand over to
                    partners for continuous improvement.</li>
                <li>Plans and results for each product and team are available for CDS and the partners to view, and are
                    linked to from a central place.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>

            <h3><strong>Categories of evaluation metrics</strong></h3>
            <h4>CDS collects qualitative and quantitative metrics in 4 categories:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Delivery</strong><br>The wellbeing, functioning and productivity of a team </li>
                <li><strong>Partner capacity</strong><br>Partners ability to work with new principles, technologies and
                    techniques</li>
                <li><strong>Product performance</strong><br>The performance and efficacy of the product and its features
                </li>
                <li><strong>Outcomes</strong><br>The impact of the product or service on people’s lives</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>

            <h3><strong>Evaluation in the delivery phases</strong></h3>
            <h4>Evaluation metrics and reporting increases in precision and frequency at each phase:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Discover</strong><br>Exploring what the metrics should be, how to get them based on
                    research, and existing baseline information about user needs</li>
                <li><strong>Alpha</strong><br>Testing and some tracking of the metrics through prototypes</li>
                <li><strong>Beta</strong><br>Benchmarking and reporting the metrics by releasing minimum viable thing
                </li>
                <li><strong>Live</strong><br>Reporting the metrics and making continuous improvements to the live
                    product</li>
            </ol>
            <hr>

            <h4>Examples of evaluation metrics</h4>

            <p>These are some examples of measurements that could be collected during each phase for each metric
                category: </p>
