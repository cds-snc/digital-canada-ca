The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is tasked with changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services, to reduce the risk of product failure, lower costs, ensure user privacy and system security, and, above all, improves people’s lives by putting their needs and concerns front and center. We believe every experience Canadians have with their government should meet or exceed their reasonable modern expectations that digital services be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. Working in the open, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

We’re hiring for a Senior Policy Advisor. While we have locations in Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, and Kitchener; we largely work distributedly and equally value candidates in other parts of Canada.

The policy team is home to CDS’ bureaucracy hackers and government navigators, enabling digital delivery with our partners and beyond. 

Policy advisors form part of CDS’s multidisciplinary product teams, working alongside product managers, developers, designers, and design researchers. We help build and improve government services by working through legislative, regulatory, and policy issues in product development. We dig into processes to find creative solutions. 

We also help build products and services that turn one-time fixes into replicable solutions, like [GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca), the Government of Canada’s (GC) notification service. We drive lessons from delivery into policy and standards-setting, advocating for changes that make it easier to do the right thing. 

Senior Policy Advisors are classified as EC-06 and EC-07 in the Economics and Social Science Services group in the Treasury Board Secretariat of the Government of Canada.

Our goal is to scale modern service design and development practices across government — in order to produce better outcomes for the public — by helping to change the relationship between policy and delivery. 

## Why join the CDS Policy team? 

In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to work with colleagues with diverse skills and experience. You’ll learn about service design and software development, as a member of multidisciplinary teams doing that work every day to better serve people and businesses across Canada. You’ll flex your problem-solving abilities on issues like privacy, equity, design research, procurement, and the adoption of modern tools. You’ll help connect  CDS’s work with Cabinet, ministers, and senior officials to scale its impact. 

## In this role, you will have the opportunity to:

- Serve on CDS product and service teams, to help navigate government legislation, regulation, policies and processes to enable delivery
- Take practical delivery lessons and work with colleagues across the government to drive changes to rules, practices and governance to help scale iterative software development and human-centred design across government
- Lead and present policy and service delivery proposals to senior officials in government to advance CDS’s mandate and mission  
- Lead efforts to research and connect the dots between government services and other areas of digital policy, such as access to broadband Internet, data management and policy, or technology and sustainability
- Build effective relationships within the federal government, Officers of Parliament, other levels of government, other countries, and other sectors
- Help measure the impact CDS is having
- Coach and mentor colleagues
 
## Skills we’re looking for:

- You want to make government better and understand how technology and design can contribute to that
- You’re great at leading complex and highly collaborative projects, including those involving change management 
- You excel at supporting people on your team in developing their skills and expertise
- You’re a strong researcher and creative problem-solver — and enjoy digging into topics to generate advice and solutions 
- You understand (or want to understand) how stuff gets done in government
- You’re good at cultivating relationships and building communities
- You communicate effectively and can translate complex issues for a wide range of audiences, both written and verbally

### Some additional knowledge and experience that would be assets include: 
- Understanding of Digital Government
- Data analysis and performance monitoring and measurement
- Privacy
- Information Security
- Accessibility, equity, and human rights, especially related to government policy or technology
- Procurement
- Working as part of multidisciplinary teams
