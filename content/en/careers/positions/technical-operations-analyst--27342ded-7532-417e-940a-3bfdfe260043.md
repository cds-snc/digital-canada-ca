## About CDS 

We believe that public services should be easy to use, secure, reliable, accessible and inclusive for everyone — especially those most in need — and we want your help!

Our mandate is to help Government improve the way it designs and delivers services to people in Canada. We empower our partners to put people at the center of services. We provide tailored help to individual organizations to make timely design and technology decisions, build capability and adopt new ways of working, and we offer common digital service building blocks — like GC Notify and GC Forms — that any government team can use to quickly stand up services. We share our work in the open and advocate for policy changes to make it easier for others to embrace agile, human-centred practices.

## About your team

The Technical Operations and Security team at CDS is tasked with serving the internal IT and security needs of the organization. Here, you’ll have the opportunity to wear multiple hats -- each day is not like the next. If you embrace change and are passionate about removing roadblocks,  we want YOU! The areas of responsibility include:

- Equipping teams with digital tools, workspaces, and operational support;
- Applying knowledge and experience with Apple products to provide hardware & software break/fix support;
- Analyzing user trends and implementing best practices to improve productivity and efficiencies across the organization;
- Troubleshooting and resolving issues in a timely manner while exhibiting exceptional customer service and communication skills;
- Utilizing IT service management process management tools and practices;
- Managing both the inventory and lifecycle of all CDS hardware (MacBooks, iPads, printers, AV equipment etc.);
- Managing both the procurement of SaaS products and assignment of licenses to CDS groups/employees based on requirements and/or requests;
- On-/Off-boarding of all CDS employees in partnership with TBS IT and People Ops;
- Sharing knowledge and expertise within the Technical Operations and Security team and CDS to strengthen the capacity of the organization — and document and share practices and lessons learned more widely to help other teams across government;
- Understanding Cloud and other tools that CDS work with and how to manage corporate and user accounts on each, including but not limited to AWS, MacOS, YubiKeys, Google Workspace, Slack, Trello, Github, Lever, Adobe, and 40+ more.
