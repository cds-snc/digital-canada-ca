The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services. We’re here to improve people’s lives by changing how the government builds technology. We do this by putting people's needs and concerns front and centre. Every experience Canadians have with their government should be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. We are working in the open to help everyone across government improve service delivery. We need you.

To further this important mission, we are looking for a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Program Manager. Building a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization is better for the members of our team, for the quality of our work, and for our ability to serve all Canadians. You can expect high impact and wide-ranging responsibility: owning DEI initiatives and strategy, collaborating throughout the organization, and advocating for a culture of belonging. You must be a builder who thrives in a learning environment—you’re unafraid to challenge the way we’ve been doing things, engage partners across and outside government, and welcome suggestions for how we can iterate on our processes. This role is classified as an [AS-06](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=15#toc993929940) in the Administrative Services group and reports to the Head of Talent.

What we’re looking for:

* You work closely with people leaders to assess and prioritize our equity and inclusion strengths and weaknesses
* You will help initiate creative and scalable changes to our existing DEI strategy with a basis in belonging
* You will use data to generate insights and translate them into actions that support our goals and drive transparency and accountability at CDS
* You will work closely with recruiting peers to source and attract talent from underrepresented groups and foster belonging
* You will work closely with People and Culture peers to create retention strategies and determine future learning opportunities
* You will deliver impactful diversity and inclusion content and training
* You will partner with our outreach team to share our progress and learnings internally and externally.

An excellent candidate will be able to:

* Manage a diversity, equity, and inclusion program in a high-growth environment 
* Understand the workplace inclusion landscape in Canada, including challenges and issues facing Canada and stakeholders.
* Think big with an expanded, holistic view and long-term perspective
* Take a human-centred approach to diversity, equity and inclusion, understanding and working to meet the needs of your “users” (people leaders and employees) 
* Use a data-driven approach to problem-solving; you enjoy making sense of trends and using the insights to better your process
* Be flexible and have a growth mindset, being able to shift tasks and priorities when circumstances change
* Communicate in both French and English (in government terms, this position is CBC).

At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we can recognize and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.

CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments. We are committed to providing an inclusive and barrier-free work environment, starting with the hiring process.
