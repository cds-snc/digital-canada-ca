The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services. We’re here to improve people’s lives by changing how the government builds technology. We do this by putting people’s needs and concerns front and centre. Every experience Canadians have with their government should be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. We are working in the open to help everyone across government improve service delivery. We need you.

At CDS, designers work on multidisciplinary teams tasked with crafting end-to-end services that serve user needs. Their work delves into crafting design considerations for all the touch-points different people might encounter while using and managing government services. This may involve the creation of—or change to—transactions, products, and content, and may stretch across digital and offline channels provided by different parts of government.

Designers are also responsible for creating intelligent, simple interactions that allow users to achieve their goals quickly and easily. Collaborating closely with other disciplines on their teams, designers observe and interpret user interactions during usability testing, and help translate research insights into design requirements. This role is classified as a [CS-04](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=1#toc12259212260) in the Computer Systems group.

What we’re looking for:

* Your approach to design starts with inclusivity and accessibility;
* You’re great at communicating with people who aren’t familiar with design, comfortable working alongside clients during the design process, and are excited to work with people on research and testing;
* You can effectively demonstrate what your detailed design process entails;
* You are passionate about users’ experiences and want to create measurable improvements to government services;
* You have experience working alongside developers and researchers and rapidly prototyping;
* Bilingualism (English and French) will be considered a strong asset.  

We recognize that everyone brings skills and experiences to the table and that not everyone “checks all the boxes”. Apply anyway! Tell us why you’re the right fit for the job.

At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we can recognize and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.

CDS welcomes all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments. We are committed to providing an inclusive and barrier-free work environment, starting with the hiring process.
