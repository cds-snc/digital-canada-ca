The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is tasked with changing how the federal government designs and delivers accessible digital services, to reduce the risk of product failure, lower costs, ensure user privacy and system security, and, above all, improves people’s lives by putting their needs and concerns front and center. We believe every experience Canadians have with their government should meet or exceed their reasonable modern expectations that digital services be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. Working in the open, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

## Partnerships

You'll join the Partnerships business unit, which grows our relationships with other government departments and helps them improve how they design and deliver their public services.  

Our Portfolio Management team searches for opportunities and helps us prioritize the engagements we take on. When we begin to partner, our Consulting Team helps us meet the department where they are, takes stock, and delivers the specific help they need by providing guidance or hands-on help to change how they serve people using technology. Where a partner wants more help to change how they’re working and show what's possible, we can dedicate an Embedded Team to work side-by-side and help them build their departmental capacity to serve people better. 

In all of our engagements, we work with public service leadership, service owners, and our colleagues to make the case for change, introduce new ways of working, and deliver the greatest public value. This means that regardless of your title and position, you'll need to be outcome focused, able to wear multiple hats, and ready to navigate government bureaucracy to get things done. Common themes for engagements include: change management, procurement (i.e. buying software or services), human centred design, and leveraging commodity solutions (i.e. cloud, etc.).  

## The role

The Team Lead, Partnerships Business Development, works with Heads of Service across the Partnerships Business unit to find potential partnership opportunities, assess their viability, and prioritize them. As the first point of contact for requests to partner with CDS, you’ll coordinate intake and triage requests in partnership with colleagues across the business unit. You will report to the Head of Portfolio Management, who in turn reports to the Executive Director of Partnerships. This role is classified as an [EC-06/EC-07](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=4#tocxx325137) in the Economics and Social Sciences group. 

## You’ll need to accomplish the following things:

- Lead and people manage a small team, while working in close collaboration with colleagues across the business unit
- Promote inclusive team operations and delivery, influence without causing harm, and uphold accessibility, diversity, impact, integrity, openness and fairness.
- Proactively seek our new potential partnership opportunities and serve as a first point of contact for incoming requests to partner with CDS. 
- Lead the development and iteration of the intake journey, to ensure we’re providing the best possible experience and value for public servants looking to engage with us
- Bring clarity to what is expected - outcomes and outputs - when partnering with CDS. 
- Work with Heads of Service within the Partnership business unit to assess and prioritize potential opportunities to partner and continuously improve the intake and assessments experience. 
- Spearhead the communication of partnership opportunities, partner trends and needs in government service delivery to the wider CDS team by working in the open via presentations, reports and updating the client relationships management (CRM) system. 


## An excellent candidate will:

- Be client-centred with excellent listening, communication, and critical thinking skills, 
- Be proactive, engaging, collaborative, and organized. 
- Be comfortable leading a small team to use agile, human-centered methods, while working in the open.
- Listen to learn, make space for new ideas and perspectives, and not shy away from difficult conversations.
