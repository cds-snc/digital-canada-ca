**About the Canadian Digital Service**

We believe that public services should be easy to use, secure, reliable, accessible and inclusive for everyone — especially those most in need — and we want your help!

Our mandate is to help government improve the way it designs and delivers services to people in Canada. We empower our partners to put people at the centre of services. We provide tailored help to individual organizations to make timely design and technology decisions, build capability and adopt new ways of working, and we offer common digital service building blocks — like GC Notify and GC Forms — that any government team can use to quickly stand up services. We share our work in the open and advocate for policy changes to make it easier for others to embrace agile, human-centred practices.

**About the Platform Business Unit**

This position resides in the Platform Business Unit which works towards empowering government to serve people better by delivering self-serve products to create and run high quality public services for Canadians.

We do so by following our principles of building in a secure, accessible, bilingual, scalable, extensible, interoperable and adaptable way which helps us build stronger relationships and trust with our clients and users.
