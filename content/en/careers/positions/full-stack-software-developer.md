The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is tasked with changing how the federal government designs and delivers accessible digital services, to reduce the risk of product failure, lower costs, ensure user privacy and system security, and, above all, improves people’s lives by putting their needs and concerns front and center. We believe every experience Canadians have with their government should meet or exceed their reasonable modern expectations that digital services be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. Working in the open, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

We’re hiring Full Stack Software Developers. While our home base is in Ottawa, we largely work distributedly across Canada and equally value candidates in other parts of Canada. Our Business Units consist of Partnerships, providing hands-on consulting with other departments, and Platforms, building and operating reusable software services.

These positions are part of the Software Development Community and report to your Product Team Lead within the Platform Business Unit.Your day-to-day will change based on which product team within a department you are assigned to and, over time, the evolving nature of work at CDS. For example, some days will involve more strategic coaching than hands-on coding.

Based on your level of experience developers are classified as [CS-03, CS-04 or CS-05](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=1#toc12259212260/) in the Computer Systems group.

**You’ll need to accomplish the following things:**

- Determining, communicating, and iteratively delivering minimal viable features and processes that will improve things for users right now. Doing this in an agile way  is critical, despite the government being waterfall driven.

- Shipping full stack web applications (UI to infrastructure). This includes architecting, coding, operating, releasing, testing, and tuning them. You’ll need to do these in the open and collaboratively on multidisciplinary teams. 
- Build prototypes and/or well-crafted, maintainable software based on the context. You may need to wear different, non-developer (UX, product) hats depending on the time and situation.

**We’ll evaluate you based on:**

- Creating and delivering software using modern web technologies and platforms such as Python, Flask, Celery, AWS, CSS, Javascript. Nice-to-haves are Terraform, Serverless, Tailwind, Docker, Kubernetes
- Creating and delivering inclusive and accessible (WCAG) software
- Employing or promoting site reliability/devops practices
