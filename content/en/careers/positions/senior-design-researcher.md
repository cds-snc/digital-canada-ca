The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services. We’re here to improve people’s lives by changing how the government builds technology. We do this by putting people’s needs and concerns front and centre. Every experience Canadians have with their government should be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. We are working in the open to help everyone across government improve service delivery. We need you.

We’re looking for an experienced Senior Design Researcher who is passionate about delivering better government services and being a vocal advocate for people’s needs.  

You’ll work on a fast-paced delivery team - either across multiple smaller services or dedicated to one larger end-to-end service. Your research will inform service, content and interaction design to meet people’s needs and policy intent.

As a Senior Design Researcher, you’ll plan and lead design research activities in small and large teams on complex services. You’ll navigate the policy and regulatory constraints of conducting research inside government. You will develop research strategy and test design, as well as lead discovery research and analysis within broad problem spaces. You will lead research in an agile environment using a range of methods, including contextual interviews, usability testing, surveys, and will lead on lean research analysis that involves the wider team whenever possible. 

You will also mentor, train and carry out activities designed to up-skill other team members in research techniques, as well as participate in recruitment activities to ensure that we continue to have the required skills within the organisation.

You’ll communicate insights from research in engaging and impactful ways to delivery teams, senior stakeholders and partner departments to drive change and improve government services.

This role is classified as a [EC-06](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=4#tocxx320842) in the Economics and Social Science Services group.

## What you’ll be doing:

* Leading the planning, design, facilitation, analysis and reporting of design research to understand people’s needs and behaviours and inform the design and development of government services; 
* Influencing how decisions are made and constructively challenging ways of thinking at both the team and senior stakeholder level;
* Leading research with other members in a digital delivery team, mentoring and up-skilling junior researchers and supporting the growth and development of the team; 
* Taking a human centered, evidence-based approach by turning design research findings into actionable insights that influence service/product development;
* Supporting digital delivery teams to build accessible digital services by ensuring that participants with access needs and low digital skills are included in all research;
* Clearly and confidently communicating insights from research and examples of best practice to technical and non-technical audiences, including senior decision makers across the government;
* Aligning design research activities with wider organisational objectives to provide strategic insights that inform service and policy design;
* Identifying, mitigating or escalating risks to conducting and implementing research.

## What we’re looking for:

* You conduct compelling research that drives product decisions. 
* You plan generative and evaluative research, and scope research plans that will lead to both short-term and long-term success in an agile environment.
* You bring users’ voices and perspectives into the service conversation. 
* You champion and present design research to skeptical audiences and help partners build their own research capabilities.
* You establish an effective human centered design culture in teams, and support them to embed human centered design practices into their agile workflow.
* You establish and apply ethical research standards and practices to ensure the safeguarding and wellbeing of participants and researchers. You also reflect on your own practice and think about what could make your research more useful, ethical, and efficient. 
* You bring diverse research audiences to help teams deliver accessible and inclusive digital services.
* You can plan and conduct research in both English and French (in government terms, this role is CBC).
