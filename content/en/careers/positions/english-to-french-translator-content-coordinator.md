The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services. We’re here to improve people’s lives by changing how the government builds technology. We do this by putting people's needs and concerns front and centre. Every experience Canadians have with their government should be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. We are working in the open to help everyone across government improve service delivery. We need you.

The Outreach team is responsible for all things storytelling at CDS. We tell stories that help public servants improve government services and make people’s lives better. We help CDS tell stories that help people work for us, work like us and work with us. We provide supporting tools and advice to help CDSers tell effective stories, and build and maintain CDS’ online presence in both official languages.

The Translator role is absolutely essential to ensure that we can fulfill our mandate in both official languages and to contribute to the on-going improvement of our team, and the content and bilingual standards across the organization.

* Communicate and write in both French and English (in government terms, this position is CCC)

* Collaborate with the other translator to improve translation workflow across the organization
* Be a source of feedback as a language professional for those wanting to create French content

An excellent candidate will be able to:

We recognize that everyone brings skills and experiences to the table and that not everyone “checks all the boxes”. Apply anyway! Tell us why you’re the right fit for the job.

At CDS, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we can recognize and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills.
