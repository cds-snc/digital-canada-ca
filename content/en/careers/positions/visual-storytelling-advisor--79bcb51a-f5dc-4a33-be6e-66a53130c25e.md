The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) works with federal departments to make the services people depend on simple and easy-to-use. We’re a small but mighty team that is rethinking service design and delivery, engaging users every step of the way. By working in the open, and connecting partners with tools, talent, and training grounded in practice, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.

This role is classified as a [IS-02 in the Information Services  group](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=15#toc993929944) and represents the IS qualification standards.


**You will:**

- Help us tell better stories, visually — whether that’s with photos, illustrations, animations, or video. We don’t need you to be an expert at all the things. We’re looking for someone who is really good at one or two of these things and interested in getting better at the rest.
- Craft great visual content to make our blog, social media accounts, presentations, website, and posters more engaging and more memorable.
- Help us cultivate a brand that resonates with our values.

**An excellent candidate will:**

- Have front end web development skills
- Have experience with Figma
- Live by these questions: “Who is the audience?”, “What do they need to know?” and “How will this make them feel?” 
- Interpret, apply and adhere to brand guidelines, without limiting creativity.
- Love to venture into their growth zone to explore, examine and visualize a wide variety of ideas.
- Be motivated to learn new image, photo, animation, illustration and video editing software.
- Collaborate by default, listen and ask if they don’t understand, and be skilled at taking ideas to the next stage.
- Transform constraints into creative levers and try new things to see if they work.
- Be comfortable with what they know and with what they don’t know. They’re not afraid to raise any questions right away, instead of midway through the work.
- Know that done is better than perfect, and understands the key to creative success is not abandonment or stubbornness, but perseverance.
- Be fluent in French et peut également parler anglais*. In Government speak, this role is ‘CBC.’
- Be based near Ottawa (in the ‘NCR’)
