## About the Canadian Digital Service
The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services. We’re here to improve people’s lives by changing how the government builds technology. We do this by putting people’s needs and concerns front and centre. Every experience Canadians have with their government should be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. We are working in the open to help everyone across the government improve service delivery. We need you.

To support this important mission, we are looking for a Content Designer to join our Learning Resources team in our Partnerships Business Unit. 

## About the Learning Resources team
As a by-product of our work and experiences partnering with government departments, over the years we have created a ton of resources that currently sit in disparate places across our organization, often inaccessible and out-of-sight by the rest of government. 

We also field questions and inquiries that overlap quite a bit, duplicating efforts and not making the best use of our collective time. There is potential to streamline our approach and point people to resources in a single all-encompassing space. 

By curating and sharing our learnings in the open, more deliberately and strategically, we'll give departments the tools they need and want, to more effectively make the case for change and build digital capacity within their 
own organizations.

## Content Designer Position 
We’re looking for an experienced Content Designer who is passionate about information and knowledge management, and being a vocal advocate for people’s needs through learning resources.

As a Content Designer, you’ll work directly with our Lead Content Designer and the rest of the UX team on Learning Resources within the Partnerships Business unit. You will be focused on meeting the information needs of public servants, as well as CDS content creators. You’ll work towards finding better ways of organizing and presenting actionable information in English and French. You will also be expected to champion the readability and accessibility of information for all people, with a particular lens on finding opportunities to reduce or eliminate cognitive load. This work presents the interesting challenge of navigating through different content types, and establishing some templates, best practices, and guidelines for future content creators at CDS.

This role is a 2 year-term position and is classified as an [IT-03 or IT-04](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=1#tocxx327633) in the Computer Systems group. CDS is a fully distributed team. This role can be performed from anywhere in Canada. In the future, occasional travel to Ottawa may be required. Bilingualism is required for this position. Government knowledge or experience is preferred for this role.

### What you’ll be doing:

- Taking a human-centred, evidence-based approach by turning data, information, and research into actionable insights that help you understand people’s needs and behaviours to inform the content design of learning resources.
- Influencing how decisions are made and constructively challenging ways of thinking both on team and with stakeholders.
- Supporting the team to build an accessible service by ensuring that people with different access and cognitive needs, differences in learning and absorbing information, and people with different skill profiles are included in everything we design.
- Identifying, mitigating or escalating risks related to content design and design more broadly within the team.

### What we’re looking for:

- You have experience leading content design for a product or service, championing inclusivity, accessibility and plain language, and initiating organizational change to make services better for users.
- You’re great at communicating with people who aren’t familiar with content design, comfortable working alongside team members and stakeholders during the design process, and are excited to work with people on research and testing.
- You’re passionate about great content design, prioritizing clarity over aesthetics and style or grammar rules, when necessary.
Your application itself shows great content design skills. 
- Priority will be given to candidates who can communicate and write in both French and English (in government terms, at a CCC level).
- Even more priority will be given to candidates who can create equally good content in both official languages, as demonstrated by past work samples. 

#### General process information
You'll join the Partnerships Business Unit, which grows our relationships with other government departments and helps them improve how they design and deliver digital services.  

In all of our engagements, we work with public service leadership, service owners, and our colleagues to make the case for change, introduce new ways of working, and deliver the greatest public value. This means that regardless of your title and position, you'll need to be outcome focused, able to wear multiple hats, and ready to navigate government bureaucracy to get things done. Common themes for engagements include: change management, procurement (i.e. buying software or services), human-centred design, and leveraging commodity solutions (i.e. cloud, etc.).

We recognize that everyone brings skills and experiences to the table and that not everyone “checks all the boxes”. Apply anyway! Tell us why you’re the right fit for the job.
