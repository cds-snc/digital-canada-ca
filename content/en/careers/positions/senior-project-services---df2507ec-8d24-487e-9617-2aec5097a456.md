## We’re looking for someone who will:

- Act as a focal point of contact within the Internal Operations team for all CDS procurement needs, such as, but not limited to, Software as a Service (SaaS), IT equipment, professional services, etc.
- Engage and collaborate with the TBS Contracting team and other partners on all procurement matters.
- Create or improve tools and processes that address CDS procurement pain points, and support the implementation of our procurement strategy.
- Provide procurement advice and guidance to CDS, and potential vendors to help move along the process of procurement. 
- Manage CDS’s procurement budget by tracking actual expenditures and providing financial forecasts.  
- Understand product teams’ work and make it easier for them to buy the services they need.
- Build a stronger understanding within CDS of the vendor community — and help vendors learn how they can navigate government procurement processes and support our team.


## You’ll fit right in if:
- You know federal procurement rules and processes inside and out.
- You’re passionate about experimenting with new ways of doing things — and measuring the impact.
- You provide open-minded, well-informed advice on procurement processes and contract management.
- You break projects into smaller tasks and like to iterate on solutions.
- You’re a creative, resourceful problem-solver. You don’t have all the answers, but you know how to find them.
- As a proven relationship builder, you’ll enjoy making connections to get stuff done.
- You’re equally comfortable charting out the big picture and diving into the details to figure out how to bring that picture to life.
- Bilingualism is a strong asset.
