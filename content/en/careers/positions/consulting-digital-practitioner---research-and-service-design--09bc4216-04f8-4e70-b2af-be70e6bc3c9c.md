The Consulting team meets departments where they are in terms of their needs and context, takes stock, and delivers the specific help needed by providing guidance or hands-on assistance to change how departments serve people using technology. This means that, as a member of this team, you'll need to be outcome focused, able to wear multiple hats, and ready to navigate government bureaucracy to get things done. Common themes for consulting include: change management, procurement (i.e. buying software or services), human centred design and research, agile software development, product and delivery management, and leveraging commodity solutions (i.e. cloud, etc.).
