The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) was established in 2017 with an ambitious mandate to help change how the federal government designs and delivers services to the public. We work with partners across government, and beyond, to put people’s needs at the centre of those services.

We are a small but mighty team of 115+ digital professionals distributed across the country. We joined from the private and public sectors, and from civic tech and non-profits, drawn by the mission to change government to serve people better. And we’re looking for our next bold, mission-driven CEO to lead our efforts to scale up our impact.

We believe federal services should be easy to use, secure, reliable, accessible, and inclusive — they need to work for everyone, especially those most in need. We know that service delivery teams across government face many challenges when doing this important work, and we work hard to put the wind at their backs and build up federal digital delivery capabilities.

- We partner directly with federal organizations to help them change how they design, build, and deliver priority public-facing services — with a focus on enduring changes that will have an impact for the people they serve not only today but into the future. Our partnerships have helped Veterans and their families, newcomers to Canada, victims of cybercrime and fraud, entrepreneurs tackling big public challenges, and others.
- We create and operate common components (platform products) that any department can easily use to build or improve services. For example, [GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca/) has been used by 184 services to send over 28 million notifications to keep the public informed of service status and other critical information. We’re also working on replacing thousands of inaccessible paper and PDF forms with mobile-friendly web forms — and collaborating with partners on a modern design system.
- We work in the open, from code to guides to lessons learned, to help clear a path for others — and because it makes our work better. 
- We channel our delivery lessons into advocacy and support for rule changes that enable all of government to adopt modern software and service delivery practices.

In everything we do, we strive to live our [CDS Values](https://digital.canada.ca/our-values/). 

The pandemic has underscored the need for governments to be able to quickly and effectively respond to people’s needs — and the central role that digital delivery plays in that. Over the past 22 months, we’ve focused heavily on contributing to the federal response to COVID-19. We launched the [COVID Alert](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html) national exposure notification app in under two months in summer 2020. We built a [COVID-19 benefits finder](https://covid-benefits.alpha.canada.ca/en/start) with Service Canada that has been used more than 2 million times to help people navigate how to get government help during the pandemic. And GC Notify supported over 30 pandemic services delivering critical information to people and businesses.

We are proud of what we’ve accomplished and the team we’ve built — and equally humbled by the lessons we’ve learned during our first four years. Now, we’re excited and ready to build on our foundations and momentum and take it to the next level. Our next CEO will use their track record of shipping products and services, leadership, and creativity to further empower our growing team and accelerate our impact working with other leaders inside and outside the federal public service. Positioned at the centre of government with a mission to change how government works, this role will meaningfully touch the lives of millions of people who engage with federal services, programs, and policy.

The CEO will set the vision and strategy that guide all CDS work, including its [partnerships](https://digital.canada.ca/coaching-and-advice/) and [platform](https://digital.canada.ca/product-suite/) services, operations, and outreach; have support from the top to maintain a laser-like focus on putting users first in everything we do; work alongside the Chief Information Officer of the Government of Canada to scale impact from the centre of government; build critical relationships with government partners; and inspire and advocate for the adoption of modern digital practices across the Government of Canada. This role has a seat at Treasury Board Secretariat senior management tables.
