<p>&#8211; Coach members of the public service on how to creatively solve problems by putting user needs, accessibility, diversity, measurement/evaluation, integrity, openness and fairness first.</p>



<p>&#8211; Work transparently, including by reporting the progress of your work in an ongoing and open fashion</p>



<p>&#8211; Demonstrate a growth and entrepreneurial mindset and solid communication skills to continuously refine your consulting and change management approach</p>
