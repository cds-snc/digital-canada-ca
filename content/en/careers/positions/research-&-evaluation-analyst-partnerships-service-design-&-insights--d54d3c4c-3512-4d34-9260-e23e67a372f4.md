The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is tasked with changing how the federal government designs and delivers accessible digital services, to reduce the risk of product failure, lower costs, ensure user privacy and system security, and, above all, improves people’s lives by putting their needs and concerns front and center. We believe every experience Canadians have with their government should meet or exceed their reasonable modern expectations that digital services be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. Working in the open, we’re building capacity across the government for better service delivery. And we need you.


**As a part of CDS’s commitment to the Call to Action on Anti-Racism, Equity and Inclusion in the Federal Public Service, in this hiring process, we will only be considering candidates who choose to self declare as an Indigenous person or as a member of a racialized group. Candidates will have an opportunity to self-declare at a later point in the application process.**



### Partnerships
The Partnerships business unit is composed of service groups that work together to establish and grow relationships with other government departments with the goal of helping them improve how they design and deliver their public services.  

Portfolio Management is a service group dedicated to serving the needs of the Partnership business unit and is composed of two teams: Intake, and Service Design & Insights. Intake assesses and prioritizes partnership opportunities for the business unit while Service Design and Insights supports the design and evaluation of Partnership services, while working in accordance with CDS values.   

### The role 
As an Analyst on the Service Design and Insights team, you’ll work closely with your team and other members of Portfolio Management to be the “Voice of the Partner” for the business unit.

- Plan and conduct research, including the design and delivery of qualitative and quantitative feedback mechanisms. 
- Analyze data to help us tell the stories about our impact and reflect on what we need to do to improve our outcomes. 



### You’ll fit right in if:

- You have a passion for making government better and understand how technology and design can help do that
- You’re knowledgeable of evaluation theories, models, methods, and tools, and know how to apply them using best practices
- You’re a strong researcher who enjoys conducting both primary and secondary research and is experienced in both qualitative and quantitative methods
