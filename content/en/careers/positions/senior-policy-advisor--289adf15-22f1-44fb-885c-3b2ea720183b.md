The Policy Team are CDS’s bureaucracy hackers and government navigators, enabling digital delivery with our partners and beyond. Our analysts form part of CDS’s multidisciplinary product teams, working alongside product managers, engineers, designers, and design researchers. We work through legislative, regulatory, and policy issues in product development. We dig into processes to find creative solutions. We build tools that turn one-time fixes into replicable solutions. We drive lessons from delivery into policy and standards-setting, advocating for changes that make it easier to do the right thing. Our goal is to scale modern service design and development practices across government — to produce better outcomes for the public — by changing the relationship between policy and delivery. 

This role is classified as **EC-06/07**  in the [Economics and Social Science Services group](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=4) in the Treasury Board Secretariat of the Government of Canada.
 
In this role, you’ll have the opportunity to work with colleagues with diverse skills and experience. You’ll flex your problem-solving abilities on issues like privacy, user research, and cloud procurement. You’ll help architect CDS’s engagements with Cabinet, ministers, and senior officials.

#### We’re looking for someone who will:

* Serve on CDS product teams, to help navigate government and problem-solve
* Take practical delivery lessons and work with TBS and departments to drive change
* Find ways to change rules, governance, and practice to mainstream iterative software development and human-centred design
* Develop small solutions and scale them to government-wide potential
* Help measure the impact CDS is having
* Coach, mentor, and help manage a team
* Plan, develop, and present briefing and decision materials to senior officials 
 
#### You’ll fit right in if:

* You have a passion for making government better and understand how technology and design can help do that
* You’re a strong researcher and problem-solver — and enjoy digging into topics to generate advice and solutions
* You have strong data analysis and/or program and policy evaluation  chops
* You understand how stuff gets done in government
* You’re great at leading teams or projects — and mentoring and developing people
* You’re good at cultivating relationships and building communities and networks
* You’re prompt to respond and communicate effectively
* You are a quick learner 
* Ideally, you’re fluent in French and English, at a government-tested level of  BBB* or better. 

**A pool of qualified persons resulting from this process MAY be created and MAY be used to fill similar positions, with linguistic profiles (english essential, bilingual imperative BBB/BBB, bilingual imperative CBC/CBC, as well as tenures (indeterminate, deployment, acting, assignment, secondment, specified period) which may vary according to the position being staffed.*
