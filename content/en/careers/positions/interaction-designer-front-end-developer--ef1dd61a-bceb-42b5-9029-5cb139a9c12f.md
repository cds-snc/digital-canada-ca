## About the Canadian Digital Service

The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is changing how the federal government designs and delivers digital services. We’re here to improve people’s lives by changing how the government builds technology. We do this by putting people’s needs and concerns front and centre. Every experience Canadians have with their government should be safe, fast, easy, transparent, and accessible. We are working in the open to help everyone across the government improve service delivery. We need you.

To support this important mission, we are looking for an Interaction Designer to join our Learning Resources team in our Partnerships Business Unit. 

## About the Learning Resources team

As a by-product of our work and experiences partnering with government departments, over the years we have created a ton of resources that currently sit in disparate places across our organization, often inaccessible and out-of-sight by the rest of the government. 

We also field questions and inquiries that overlap quite a bit, potentially duplicating efforts and not making the best use of our collective time. There is potential in streamlining our approach to pointing people to resources in a single all-encompassing space. 

By curating and sharing our learnings in the open more deliberately and strategically, we'll give departments the tools they need and want, to more effectively make the case for change and build digital capacity within their 
own organizations

Senior Interaction Designer, with strong front-end dev skills [(CS-04)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=1#tocxx327633)
Interaction designers work out the best way to let users interact with services, both in terms of overall flow and at the level of individual design elements.

We’re looking for experienced Interaction designers with strong front-end development skills – who are passionate about accessibility and information design.

As an Interaction Designer in the Partnerships Business unit, you’ll be taking the lead on designing a centralized space for learning resources that meets official languages and WCAG 2.1 Level AAA accessibility – including an application to publish learning resources, and a front-facing interface for people to browse learning resources. 

You will be responsible for creating intelligent, simple interactions that allow users to achieve their goals quickly and easily. You will collaborate extensively with developers, should be comfortable with code (HTML, CSS, GitHub), and able to rapidly develop low and high-fidelity prototypes. Interaction designers also observe and interpret user interactions during usability testing and help translate research insights into design requirements.

## What you’ll be doing:

- Determining, communicating, and iteratively delivering minimal viable features and processes that will improve things for users. 
- Architecting and coding web-based software systems that are reliable, maintainable, safe, and accessible
- Knowledge of best-practices on web performance, cross-browser/device compatibility and good automated tests coverage
- Discovering user/business needs and operational bottlenecks
- Promoting inclusive delivery and upholding impact, openness, integrity and fairness.
- Leading front-end development (built from UI to infrastructure). This includes coding, operating, releasing, testing, and tuning. You’ll need to do these in the open and collaboratively on cross-functional teams. 
- Build prototypes and/or well-crafted, maintainable software based on the context. 
- Listen to, learn from, and help fellow government employees/departments improve how they work and deliver public services – help with change management, promote the Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) and human-centered design.

## What we’re looking for:

- Your approach to design and development starts with inclusivity and accessibility.
- You are great at communicating with people who aren’t familiar with design or development, comfortable working alongside peers/government stakeholders during the design and development process, and are excited to work with people on research and testing.
- You can effectively demonstrate what your detailed design and development processes entail and are confident advising the team, senior leaders, and non-technical audiences.
- You thrive in highly variable, multi-stakeholder environments.
- You are excited about knowledge management and sharing.
- You are passionate about users’ experiences and want to create measurable improvements to information design and development.
- You have experience working alongside other developers, researchers, and other designers to rapidly prototype.

## General process information
You'll join the Partnerships business unit, which grows our relationships with other government departments and helps them improve how they design and deliver digital services.  

Our Business Development team searches for opportunities and helps us prioritize the engagements we take on by their impact and feasibility. When we begin to partner, our Consulting Team helps us meet the department where they are, take stock, and deliver the specific help they need by providing guidance or hands-on assistance to change how they serve people using technology. Where a partner wants more help to change how they’re working and show what's possible, we'll provide an Embedded Team to work side-by-side and help them build high fidelity prototypes while sharing our methods hands-on. 

In all of our engagements, we work with public service leadership, service owners, and our colleagues to make the case for change, introduce new ways of working, and deliver the greatest public value. This means that regardless of your title and position, you'll need to be outcome focused, able to wear multiple hats, and ready to navigate government bureaucracy to get things done. Common themes for engagements include: change management, procurement (i.e. buying software or services), human centred design, and leveraging commodity solutions (i.e. cloud, etc.).

We recognize that everyone brings skills and experiences to the table and that not everyone “checks all the boxes”. Apply anyway! Tell us why you’re the right fit for the job.

At CDS, we don’t just accept difference – we celebrate it. We proudly, passionately, and actively strive to make CDS more reflective and inclusive of the society that we serve. Our ability to deliver better public services — accessible, inclusive services — can only be realized if we can recognize and harness the most diverse range of thoughts, experiences, and skills. We work hard to create an environment where different perspectives and experiences are valued. We are committed to helping diverse talent thrive.

CDS invites all applicants regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or family commitments. We are committed to providing an inclusive and barrier-free work environment, starting with the hiring process.
