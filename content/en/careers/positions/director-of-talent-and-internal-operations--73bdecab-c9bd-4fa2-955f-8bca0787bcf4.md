We believe that public services should be easy to use, secure, reliable, accessible, and inclusive for everyone — especially those most in need — and we want your help!
 
Our mandate is to help government improve the way it designs and delivers services to people in Canada. We empower our partners to put people at the centre of services. We provide tailored help to individual organizations to make timely design and technology decisions, build capability and adopt new ways of working, and we offer common digital service building blocks – like [GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca/) and [GC Forms](https://forms-formulaires.alpha.canada.ca/en/welcome-bienvenue) – that any government team can use to quickly stand up services. We share our work in the open and advocate for policy changes to make it easier for others to embrace agile, human-centred practices.
