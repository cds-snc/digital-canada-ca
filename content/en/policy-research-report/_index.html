        <h2><strong>Problem Statement</strong></h2>
        <p>In recent customer feedback sessions, 52% of customers have expressed a need for a simpler and
            cheaper version of our product. In surveys of customers who have chosen competitor watches, price is
            mentioned 87% of the time. To best serve our existing customers, and to branch into new markets, we
            need to develop a series of watches that we can sell at an appropriate price point for this market.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></h2>
        <p>Our new watch series will begin at 20% cheaper than our current cheapest option, with the potential
            for 40%+ cheaper options depending on material and movement. In order to offer these prices, we will
            do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Offer watches in new materials, including potentially silicone or wood</li>
            <li>Use high-quality quartz movement instead of in-house automatic movement</li>
            <li>Introduce customizable band options, with a focus on choice and flexibility over traditional
                luxury</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that every watch will still be rigorously quality controlled in order to maintain the same
            world-class speed and precision of our current offerings.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2><strong>Value</strong></h2>
        <p>With new offerings that are between 20% and 40% cheaper than our current cheapest option, we expect
            to be able to break into the casual watch market, while still supporting our luxury brand. That will
            help us hit FY22’s Objective 3: Expanding the brand. These new offerings have the potential to bring
            in upwards of three million dollars in profits annually, which will help us hit FY22’s Objective 1:
            7 million dollars in annual profit.</p>
        <p>Early customer feedback sessions indicate that cheaper options will not impact the value or prestige
            of the luxury brand, though this is a risk that should be factored in during design. In order to
            mitigate that risk, the product marketing team will begin working on their go-to-market strategy six
            months before the launch.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2><strong>Final Thoughts & Next Steps</strong></h2>
        <p>Cheaper and varied offerings not only allow us to break into a new market—it will also expand our
            brand in a positive way. With the attention from these new offerings, plus the anticipated demand
            for cheaper watches, we expect to increase market share by 2% annually. For more information, read
