                    and agencies to design and build simple and reliable technology. We’re here to improve people’s
                    lives by putting their needs and concerns at the centre of government services.

                <p><strong>We put people first</strong></p>
                <p>We act on what people tell us they need. Adding new technology to people’s lives doesn't solve
                    problems. Putting people at the heart of technology does. Through design research, we involve people
                    every step of the way to make sure that what we build works for those who actually use it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    People and technology change; our <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/products">products</a> should
                    change with them. We develop digital services through continuous improvement. This means we test our
                    work and tools, find ways to make them better, and test again.

                <p><strong>We hack the bureaucracy</strong></p>
                <p>With the right tools and practices, federal departments and agencies can do their best work. We
                    interpret and inform policy to help scale digital methods across government. We help reduce risk for
                    departments by being a safe place to try new ways of working.</p>

                    how we work. We share our successes and failures to help others learn from what we do. We want to
                    show what’s possible and empower government to make it a reality.</p>
