                    partner departments to design and build simple and reliable services. Along the way, we work with
                    our partners in iterative and people-centred methods. When our work is done, they’re empowered to
                    support and continuously improve their service.

                <p>We act on what people tell us they need. Adding new technology to people’s lives doesn't solve
                    problems. Putting people at the heart of technology does. Through design research, we involve people
                    every step of the way to make sure what we build works for those who actually use it.</p>

                <p>With the right tools, federal departments and agencies can do their best work. We interpret and inform policy to help scale digital methods across government. We help reduce risk for departments by being a safe place to try new ways of working.</p>
